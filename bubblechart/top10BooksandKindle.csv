She is no longer a young girl, and her feelings are no longer the same, they are stronger.  She works for Justin's company for two reasons: the obvious one is she needs a job, and the one most important to her is it keeps her close to Justin.  She has lusted after him for years, but he treats her like one of the guys.  She has tried just being his friend, but it leaves her on the edge of  sanity and just out of range of his love.Desperation breeds actions that are a little too unorthodox and very questionable.  Lacey's seduction is not working and after being pushed to the limits of her tolerance, she takes her efforts to another stage, literally.  Lacey winds up performing at a local hot spot in Atlanta's night life, Magic City.  Will this get Justin's attention and will it push him into action?  All Lacey wants are whispered promises, unforgettable nights and a lasting love with him.IF EVER is the question many women will ask themselves when they are vying for the attention of that certain someone.  This short story is about the pursuit of love, and about not losing yourself in the process.

There's just the little issue of her love for Wolfe, Cash and Travis and how wrong loving them seems.Brothers Wolfe, Cash and Travis have been in love with Stacy for years.  They've done their best to protect her from her father's bullying and hateful attitude.  They've never expressed their feelings to Stacy and now with her father gone they feel it's time for her to come back to the ranch - where she belongs - as their woman.Stacy's guilt over the perceived wrong on being in love with three men is emotionally agonizing.  She's convinced her only option is to sell the beloved ranch and return to Great Falls as soon as possible.  Only first she has to consult the attorney about the property and for some reason the man is never available.  That means she spends a lot of time around the ranch and avoiding Wolfe, Cash and Travis is impossible especially when each of them keeps such a close eye on her.  When each man individually seduces her she becomes even more confused and scared.  Despite the men's insistence that she is home, she's determined to leave and doesn't believe there's any way she can confide in them about her feelings for them all.  As it is she's afraid they're going to find out that's she's cheated on each of them with their own brother.  Only there are things that Stacy doesn't know which will shock and change everything she's ever believed.

It's an OK story. Nothing special, but nothing bad either.There's little to no drama in the book. All good romances need an obstacle. One lover doesn't feel he's deserving of the love of another, a shameful past, a history of abuse leaves someone's heart shuttered.... what makes a romance a hit to the heart is when love can conquer seemingly impossible odds and thrive. While this story was quite sweet, there were no obstacles with the exception of an event late in the story that, while inconvenient, doesn't really pose as an obstacle to these two men. Here, the men meet, pretty much decide they're perfect for each other, and that's that. Also, the characters could have used a bit more detail and nuance. They didn't come off as being very unique.It was a sweet enough story, but just lacked memorable touches. For instance, Carol Lynn writes a series called Cattle Valley. Her characters in those stories are all quite unique, the setting is imaginative (a closed community built on tolerance, predominately inhabited by gays), and the obstacles within each story compelling (for instance, an anti-religion contractor who falls for the town pastor). This lacks that imagination.

I bemoaned the fact that she didn't have another book coming out any time soon. Apparently, I wasn't the only one who wanted more from her, and as soon as possible! Cynthia listened to the pleas of her eager new fans and has made her books of The Garden Series available as eBooks.HARD TO BELIEVEReaders, you'll find it hard to believe, but these evocative, emotional romance novels made the rounds of editors and agents for years without capturing a contract. They came close many times, and Cynthia finaled in Romance Writers of America's annual Golden Heart contest for unpublished writers, but the end result was a stack of ""glowing"" rejection letters. Their loss is our gain because we can buy these wonderful romance novels at such low prices.STRONG BELIEFWriters sometimes believe so strongly in the worth of a story that they don't give up, and that's a very good thing for readers because In the Garden of Temptation is a gem worthy of a place on your keeper shelf. Thankfully, eBook reader devices, like my Kindle on which I downloaded In the Garden of Temptation, Book 1 of The Garden Series, make the size of a keeper shelf immense. Let me tell you about this story.NO SPOILERSIt's hard to tell what this story is about without revealing some neat twists, but I'll try.Adam Stanford, Earl of Ashworth, is a man who is honorable and above reproach. He's always done the right thing. Then he meets the beautiful -- and married -- Lady Catherine Bourgeault, the beautiful, young wife of one of the most disreputable men in England.Stunned by a passion and a love that no amount of conscience can deny, Catherine and Adam risk everything for a few moments of stolen bliss. Unknown to them, every event from their introduction to the consummation of their love has been orchestrated by Catherine's evil, demented husband for his own dark purpose.When Baron Bourgeault finally springs his trap, Catherine is forced to break Adam's heart in order to save him. The baron whisks her away to his crumbling castle in the country. As he sinks deeper and deeper into his psychosis, Catherine knows that her life, and all she holds dear, may be forfeit unless the power of redeeming love can save her.CHARGED EMOTIONI read this book while I sat in the surgical waiting room last week. My daughter was having her third surgery in 18 months, and I was a basket case who could hardly take the slow movement of the hands of the clock. A two hour surgery turned into four and continued. If I hadn't had this book to read, I don't know what I'd have done. I can hardly believe that Catherine and Adam's emotional journey captured my attention sufficiently as to calm my nerves and give me brief respite from worry, but it did. I devoured the book.BOTTOM LINEThis is the second novel I've read by Cynthia Wicklund, and it's truly another winner. I can't recommend her books highly enough. She has a way with women characters and the knack for presenting them as likable and honorable even when they may not be engaged in honorable actions. I understand these women, and I like them.Her talent with characters extends to men. In Lord of Always, she took an evil man and made him the kind of man we'd all want in our lives. In Temptation, she takes an honorable man and makes him behave dishonorably, but we don't care! We still like him. We understand how he is in the grip of a love he never expected to feel. We see his battle with his conscience. Despite what he does, he's heroic.I'm off to purchase the next books in the series. Book 2 is In the Garden of Seduction, and Book 3 is In the Garden of Disgrace.Of course, I'm going to buy the Kindle Editions, but you can get them in other formats or in Kindle for other apps, not just for the Kindle Reader.

He is largely absent from the world, choosing not to interact with his many roommates, and having little experience with quality human interaction. That is, this is Argus' life until now. A mysterious encounter with a stranger leaves Argus with a strange box filled with seemingly unrelated artifacts. He doesn't know what it all means, and, with an absent family and no real friends, he doesn't have anyone to ask. When one of his roommates reaches out to him in kindness one night and notices the odd collection, the roommates set out on an adventure to discover the meaning behind the mystery.Tom Lichtenberg has written a short novel that is both appealing and spellbinding as you discover clues right along with Argus.

The talk turns serious when one of the women reveals that she has breast cancer.This short story shines with the theme of friendship and what lengths one friend will go to in order to help the other.  If we all have a friend in our lives like these two, then we're very lucky.  The story is well-written and the ending is one I didn't expect.

Surprised because the story captured me in it's snare but also sad because the term &#34;Uncle Tom&#34; has become a perjorative.  Uncle Tom is in fact a hero and you will have to read the story to find out why.  Harriet Beecher Stowe was impelled to write this story after a federal law was passed in 1850 that would require free states to return runaway slaves who made it north to freedom back to their owners in slave states.  The authors passion is evident throughout the story and she used the characters of the story to ably present many of the arguments for and against slavery as well as presenting the human cost to men, women and children who were sold into bondage and the moral and ethical cost to whites and others involved in the slave trade (although, if you have ever seen pictures of slaves nothing can ever put into words the real cost).  This topic is still relevant today because slavery has not really ended in our world.  It has changed and is not always evident as slavery but it is still with us.  As are many of the same arguments that were made two hundred years ago to justify slavery, prejudice and the subjugation of people.  It is a bit hard at first to get through the narrative because the words and structure are becoming archaic to current readers but I encourage anyone who has not read the book to put down the cliff notes and read it in it's entirety.  It is an education as well as a compelling story that deserves to be discussed and argued as part of current history, morals, and ethics.",A must read for everyone,Literature & Fiction,Visit Amazon's Harriet Beecher Stowe Page,Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin - Kindle edition,1630.0,kindle,4.67

"" Mark of the Loon "" is less about solving a defined mystery, because it is unknown what exactly the mystery is until the final pages, as it is about establishing the who, what, whys and wheres of the primary characters.  The mystery is merely the icing on the full flavored cake. Yum.  I have read volume three in this series before volume one and admittedly it is a more defined mystery. But it was so good I decided knowing more about these characters was well worth pursuing for this armchair sleuth.  I was not disappointed.  Ms. Green is very good at defining characters via their actions and dialogue.  The dialogue is so well crafted the reader feels they are sitting in an armchair or at the table with those in discussion instead of reading words on a page.  Ms. Green does not rush her story. Actions are carefully included to create a more realistic written word world defined as much by place as actions and events.  And the author's word world adds superstructure upon what we have learned in the story and adds dimension and chiaroscuro to the lines on the page.  I am a fan.  Keep on writing Molly Greene. I look forward to book two of this series and hopefully there will be books beyond # three.

And she knows how to set a scene. However, in a story like this, that is undermined by a lack of characterization and a story that is too rushed. As a reader, I never really got a sense of why Connie wanted to be what the author calls a ""hotwife."" (As a side note here, there are a lot of euphamisms for this type of wife-watching story: loving wives, cheating wives, cuckold...I find hotwife one of the sillier ones.) Beyond the fact that she really wants to have sex with her co-worker, we never really get a sense of who she is at all. But when the sex comes, it's hot. Very hot...but then undermined by dialogue that gets silly at times. Be warned, this isn't just a wife-watching story, but a hardcore cuckold story. He doesn't just want to watch Connie, he wants to be humiliated by the experience. So I am of two minds about this story: it's hot, absolutely, but it should have been more.

I was intrigued by the concept that Winnie the Pooh could teach people academic concepts. It seemed like such a cute novel idea. I wasn't certain if I even took the idea seriously, but after reading the book not only have I learned about the basic concepts of Taoism, but I was taken for a joyous ride.What was amazing about this book is that it teaches you the principles of Taoism by stating full well it will not be a book of stuffy academic knowledge. Instead Pooh and his friends interrupt the book and you read about their adventures and tales that highlight some of the major concepts of Taoism. It's written in such a fluid way that the reader can not really know when the author stops talking and when the beloved characters of Piglet, Pooh, Eeyore and others take over.The book does not aim to be pretentious or horde this philosophy as the only correct philosophy. Instead, we're introduced to Taoism shown how the concepts work in all of our lives-especially Pooh and friends, and told that understanding certain jargon isn't essential to being a Taoist expert. As long as we practice the concepts and ideals we are living a Taoist lifestyle.The book is a wonderful mixture of simplicity and wisdom.

These consoling fantasies are her heart's answer to the family story that as a child, in unclear circumstances, Lily accidentally shot and killed her mother. All Lily has left of Deborah is a strange image of a Black Madonna, with the words ""Tiburon, South Carolina"" scrawled on the back. The search for a mother, and the need to mother oneself, are crucial elements in this well-written coming-of-age story set in the early 1960s against a background of racial violence and unrest. When Lily's beloved nanny, Rosaleen, manages to insult a group of angry white men on her way to register to vote and has to skip town, Lily takes the opportunity to go with her, fleeing to the only place she can think of--Tiburon, South Carolina--determined to find out more about her dead mother. Although the plot threads are too neatly trimmed, The Secret Life of Bees is a carefully crafted novel with an inspired depiction of character. The legend of the Black Madonna and the brave, kind, peculiar women who perpetuate Lily's story dominate the second half of the book, placing Kidd's debut novel squarely in the honored tradition of the Southern Gothic.",Enjoyed reading this book,Literature & Fiction,Visit Amazon's Sue Monk Kidd Page,The Secret Life of Bees,7875.0,hardcover,4.67

Growing up here and there in the U.S. and oversea, my world was not one immersed in poetry.  My mother and father were not ones for plentiful or frequent words about much of anything let alone the recitation of poetry.  But here and there through out my young life I was exposed to poetry, but they were nothing more than swirling leaves on an autumn day in New England: pretty, colorful, but all too soon they were gone from memory.So how is it that I became a poet, one might ask.  The same way all poets come to the art; by change or circumstance.  In my case an emotionally jarring episode in my life bade me to seek poetry as an outlet for my pain.  So I started to write crude, but deeply felt poetry.  It flowed like a river to the waling ocean, strong, emotive; swirling in all directions. After I became part of a few on-line poetry communities I started to refine my craft, and so I sought out the works of past poets; I needed to read their words, observe their craft in order to improve mine own.  This quest inevitably led me to Roy J. Cook's celebrated compilation of ""101 Famous Poems.""It was 1916 when Roy J. Cook first compiled 101 Famous Poems, his now popular anthology that not only included American poets of note, but some of the British masters as well.  The book in various form, published by varied Publishing houses, has remained in print since its initial publishing date; a testimony to its popularity.  Not many book printed in the early part of last century can make such a boast.  My copy of ""One Hundred and One Famous Poems"" was published in 1994.Of the American poets clearly one-third of the 'famous poems' belong to just twelve noted American poets: Ralph Waldo Emerson (4), John Greenleaf Whittier (3), Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (7), Oliver Wendell Holmes (3), William Cullen Bryant (2), Eugene Field (3), Vachel Lindsay (2), James Russell Lowell (2), Edwin Markham (2), Edgar Allan Poe (2), James Whitcomb Riley (2), Edward Sill (2), Emily Dickinson (1), Walt Whitman (1).A further one-third of ""101 Famous Poems"" is given over to fifteen noted English poets including Elizabeth and Robert Browning (3), Robert Burns (3), George Gorton Byron (2), Rudyard Kipling (3), Sir Walter Scott (2), Percy Bysshe Shelley (3), Alfred Tennyson (2), and William Wordsworth (5). And what anthology of famous poetry would be complete without the words of the Bard, William Shakespeare (5), to make it so.  Other British poets include Thomas Gray, George Elliott, James Henry Leigh Hunt, John Keats, and John Milton with one poem each.There is very little commentary in ""101 Famous Poems""; instead there is a rich mosaic of Western poetry written by the masters of classic 16th - early 20th century poetry; the age of classic flowing (rules based) verse, and copious amounts of rhyme and thought provoking reflective writing.There are no chapters within this treasure trove, only poem after enriching poem; these are the poems that helped shape Western Literature and popular notions of love and romance, and reflection of the harness and beauty of life; to wit:Not In Vain by Emily Dickinson (Dec. 10, 1830 - May 15, 1886)If I can stop one heart from breaking,I shall not live in vain:If I can ease one life the aching,Or cool one pain,Or help one fainting robinUnto his nest again,I shall not live in vainIf you are an aspiring poet, or just love to read poetry, ""101 Famous Poems"" should most certainly be on your nightstand of poetic inspiration.",If only all humans bathed their souls in poetry...,Literature & Fiction,Roy J.

441,8912,8912,403582,A37DTO57JS15PX,0195007778,The Czar of Arkansas,3.0,2009,"A Sand County Almanac has been touted for decades as a classic of conservation.  So, being involved in conservation, I decided that it was past time to read this work.  I started reading in high hopes based on such high praise, but, at the risk of being torched by legions of Leopold's fans, I must admit that I found A Sand County Almanac disappointing.First, A Sand County Almanac is not a book in any unitary sense; it's a compilation of different essays on a number of topics that have been compiled into a single volume.  This helter-skelter arrangement gives the work a very disjointed feel, in my opinion.  Anthologies are not fundamentally a bad thing, but I felt that the subsections of A Sand County Almanac were either too short or not substantive enough to stand alone; hence, the editors felt obliged to produce a hodge-podge of Leopold's work in order to have a book of sufficient legnth.  The sections do not sound as if they were contemporaneously written, which adds to the inconsistent feel of the work.Second, as noted above, A Sand County Almanac was published posthumously, and was therefore not subject to Leopold's editorial direction.  I'm not sure that A Sand County Almanac, as it stands now, would have been Leopold's last testament if he had been given a chance to write one.  The last section of the book, ""The Upshot,"" is sadly the smallest section, but by far the section with the most weight.  The ideas of this section are challenging and inspired, but sadly, left to the very end.  I'm not sure that there's any good way to arrange the curious mix of things in A Sand County Almanac, but I didn't like this section being placed at the end.  Perhaps the editors thought this would allow the compilation to end on a high note; however, I felt that the most profound section was left shortest and last, as if the most important ideas in the book were treated as little more than an epilogue.Only the first section of A Sand County Almanac is truly so; the reader is treated to the longest section of the book as Leopold describes the landscape month by month at his farm at Sand County, Wisconsin.  This section's repetitive format I found monotonous by the end and thought it was only saved by Leopold's prose, to which I will return momentarily.Another thing I found off-putting about A Sand County Almanac was the shrill tone of Leopold during certain passages.  As I said before, this was published posthumously, and Leopold didn't get a chance to edit the text, so we can excuse some of the tone for that reason.Nevertheless, Leopold seems to have little but disdain for those who should have been sympathetic to his viewpoint:  hunters, fishermen, state and federal conservation agencies, fellow citizens who were conservation-minded, teachers and professors (even though Leopold was a professor himself).  Even some bird watchers come in for scorn for not being serious enough.  While these passages were clearly written during the early days of organized conservation, Leopold comes off occasionally as a sneering know-it-all.  From the tone of the text, the reader is left with the definitive impression that Leopold knew more than everyone else and wasn't shy about letting you know.  These passages cast Leopold as an intolerant zealot, interested more in followers than fellows.All of the above being said, A Sand County Almanac is far from disaster.  Leopold's prose is really something to behold.  The flow of his praise has an almost Victorian cadence, which adds an aura of reverence and respect for nature in even the most boring passages of the book.  His prose causes his work to soar in the best passages, and adds a measure of profundity to the last section of his book on conservation philosophy.I'm convinced that Leopold is justly famous not for A Sand County Almanac, but rather Game Management and his pioneering work in the game management field.  Without the publishing of Game Management, A Sand County Almanac would probably be relegated to a dusty memoir, if published at all.  Nevertheless, Leopold is a gifted writer and the final section is worth serious contemplation.",Disappointed by Leopold,Literature & Fiction,Visit Amazon's Aldo Leopold Page,A Sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There,10115.0,hardcover,4.0
542,29087,29087,403536,A2VMT89TCSF105,0195007778,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""",3.0,2010,"""A Sand County Almanac"" by Aldo Leopold was first published in 1949. I have the Oxford University Press paperback edition (the one with the honkers at the cover). As far as I understand, this edition contains all of the original work. Other editions leave out parts of sections II and III. The OUP edition is beautifully illustrated by Charles W. Schwartz.Although less known than Carson's ""Silent Spring"", Leopold's ""A Sand County Almanac"" is considered a classic by the conservationist and environmentalist movements. Leopold was a leading conservationist himself and a co-founder of the Wilderness Society, an organization devoted to the expansion and protection of wilderness areas. Deep ecologists consider ""A Sound County Almanac"" a precursor to their own philosophy, because of Leopold's attempt to formulate a ""land ethic"" which takes into consideration the entire ""biotic community"", not just humans. Said Leopold: ""A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.""Most of the almanac consists of short descriptions and reflections on wildlife, most of them based on observations around Leopold's backwoods farm in Wisconsin. He seems to have deliberately obtained a small and run down piece of property. Occasionally, the area was so flooded that Leopold couldn't make it to his job (he was professor at the university of Wisconsin-Madison).Often, Leopold's sketches simply deal with the beauties of trees, flowering plants and animals (such as honkers). The author also writes about his hunting trips - in contrast to animal rights activists, Leopold was no vegan. However, he seems to have given up killing large mammal predators, preferring instead to hunt birds strictly for food. Still, this part of the book will definitely be objectionable to animal liberationists, as when Leopold glowingly retells a childhood memory of his first (and succesful) duck hunt.At other times, Leopold's descriptions of nature and wildlife have a more political or philosophical tinge. A recurrent theme is the interdependence of living organisms, as when Leopold muses that his refusal to deal with various forms of tree sickness around his farm has made the environment more diverse. A nostalgic encounter with a Silphium plant becomes an opportunity to bemoan the disappearence of the original prairie landscape. The author admits to like aspens, tamaracks and cottonwood, three species of trees heartily hated by his neighbours, not to mention foresters. The message is clear: the trees are good in themselves, they are aesthetically pleasing and make the environment more diverse and interesting. That they are economically unviable or a nuisance to humans should be irrelevant. Leopold's panegyric to the extinct passanger pigeon is my favourite piece. The fact that humans can mourn the loss of the pigeon, while the pigeon cannot mourn the loss of humans, is to Leopold what really makes us higher than the brutes.In the third section of the book, called ""The Upshot"", Leopold presents his philosophical views. He wants to extend ethics to all of creation: animals, plants and the land itself. He attacks the massive tourism in wildnerness areas, and in general opposes human encroachments on wild nature. He doesn't idealize farmers as somehow being closer to the land. Quite the contrary: there are plenty of sharp attacks on farmers in this book, farmers who farm for profit only, and take conservationist measures only if given handouts from the public treasury. It seems that Leopold is calling for more government regulation. National parks should be made much larger by buying out farms or compensating the farmers for livestock lost to predation. Obviously, this can only be done by state or federal authorities.""A Sand County Almanac"" criticizes the utilitarian and economic ethos of modern civilization, where animals and plants are saved only to the extent they are believed to be useful to humans. The author believes that only about 5% of the species of ""higher"" animals and plants found in Wisconsin have economic value for humans. Yet, all species have the right to exist, since the stability of the environment or ""biotic community"" as a whole depends on it. (Presumably, this principle also applies to environments that aren't economically useful to humans.) I get the impression that Leopold was somewhat pessimistic about the prospects of saving nature from the encroachments of modern civilization. The situation has hardly improved since his death in 1948.Despite its descriptions of animals and plants, ""A Sand County Almanac"" isn't a natural history. Nor is it a stringent philosophical work. The chapter on the land ethic isn't argued at great length. ""A Sand County Almanac"" is rather a series of short meditations on nature, wildlife and the human predicament. If you like it or not probably depends on your mood or personal attitude.People who feel nothing when walking in a park or visiting a duckpond won't like the ""real"" nature sketches in this book. Those who admire the steelworks of Hank Rearden or railways of Dagny Taggart will reel! As already noted, animal rights activists will (ironically) be horrified by the author shooting grouse, partridges and ducks. Even more ironically, the almanac might strike avid hunters and outdoorsmen as too boring. Most of the time, Leopold doesn't stray far from his small farmstead and the beloved tamaracks. He is no Bernd Heinrich, hot on the trail of wolves in Yellowstone and fascinated by their blood-curling hunts.

Sheriff Walt Longmire of Absaroka County, Wyoming turned out to be a charmer. This is the first book in the series.Walt has been mourning his dead wife for too many years - neglecting his duties, gaining weight and living like a pig. His receptionist wants him to get a girlfriend. His best friend Henry Standing Bear wants him to exercise. His female deputy is disgusted. But it takes a devil of a case to get Walt fully functional again.Two years back a young Indian girl was brutally raped by four boys, and the sentences they got were way too light. Now it looks as if someone has decided to correct this injustice by shooting them dead one by one.The sheriff can't believe anything could be happening in the most under-populated county in the most under-populated state in the union. But once Walt gets going, he's formidable. You can look forward to truck chases, shoot-outs, narrow escapes from death and lots of information about ballistics.Even when terrible things are happening, the dialog is often very funny. I couldn't get enough of Henry Standing Bear - bar keeper, sharpshooter, Cheyenne mystic and hottie. Or the bantering proprietress of the Busy Bee Caf&eacute;.

I decided to read her first one, The Joy Luck Club.Earlier I had read another of Tan's books and liked it, but this one was a disappointment to me. It involves four women who were born in China and came to this country as adults, and their daughters. The mothers have retained their Chinese ways. They agonize over the western ways of their daughters who have been raised in the U.S. The story is told in a series of vignettes. One of my problems was that I'm not used to Chinese names so I had to keep looking back to see which person's story I was reading. At the end of the book I was still checking the names, which means of course that I wasn't involved enough to get to know them by their names.The mothers' stories were definitely more interesting, even though the daughters had their own difficulties with their strict and suspicious mothers as they tried to assimilate with their friends and neighbors. One mother, for instance, had been widowed young in China and then tricked into becoming the fourth wife of a rich man. Her story was engrossing, and maddening for an American reader.Amy Tan is a great writer but it amazes me that this book was the one that made her famous.

The story starts with 39-year-old Sophie Honeywell finding out that she has inherited a house on Scribbly Gum Island on the Hawkesbury River. The house has been left to her by Connie Thrum, the Great Aunt of her ex-boyfriend, Thomas Gordon, and causes some commotion within the extended family on the island. Scribbly Gum Island is famous for the ""Munro Baby Mystery"", a seventy-year-old unsolved crime involving a cake, a kettle, some bloodstains and a newborn baby. Sophie takes up residence on the Island and becomes involved in the lives of its eccentric inhabitants. Sophie views her life as a romantic comedy, but soon enough she feels it turning into a sitcom, what with her attraction to a married man, icy river swims with an octogenarian, the (rather loud) ticking of her biological clock and making fairy floss for the annual Anniversary celebrations. Moriarty's characters have hidden depths and the plot has more than enough intrigue and twists to make this novel hard to put down. The wry inner monologues of some characters give the reader plenty of laughter, but there are also some thought-provoking and lump-in-the-throat moments. Moriarty manages to touch on a myriad of topical subjects: lesbianism, post-natal depression, nut allergy, parental cruelty, mothering instinct, suicide, support groups, children's fiction and bonding with newborn babies. I especially loved Sophie's thought: It doesn't seem good etiquette to help prove someone a murderer after they've left you a house....

Dionne ""Chrissy Dionne""",5.0,2009,"Rebecca `Becky' Yaeger's plans for the evening did not include being attacked by a psycho who sprouts claws and fangs.  It was supposed to be a fun filled evening with friends at a masquerade party but instead she's fighting for her life and all of a sudden her life is irreversibly changed.  She certainly never suspected that her friends and Simon, the man she loves, have the ability to shift into Pumas.  Sure she wants Simon but eating cat chow and using a litter box holds absolutely no appeal so what's a girl to do?Simon already suspected that Becky is his mate before the attack but he hadn't claimed her or even let on that he had any intentions toward her.  His mate's life being threatened brings out all his protective instincts and he certainly isn't about to listen to Becky's arguments against their mating.  It's a done deal as far as he's concerned.  Before he can satisfy his inner animal and mate Becky though he has to take care of her injuries and even then she argues with him.  It's when she tells him `bite me' that he sees the perfect opportunity to get exactly what he wants - to claim her.  There's no denying that they're mated after he's marked her as his!Livia's attack on Becky was completely unprovoked and makes absolutely no sense to her - all she knows is that Livia has suddenly sprouted claws and fangs and is intent on killing her.  It isn't until Becky's best friend Emma arrives that the pieces begin to fit together.  Livia's envious of Emma's status within the pride and believes that if she can acquire the Curana's ring then she'll be queen instead of Emma.  That's not how things work though and `Senora Psychopath' is in for a rude awakening because Max, Emma and Simon aren't about to let her get away with what she's done.  Livia's sentenced to life as an outcast and Simon carries Becky off as his new mate.  If Simon thinks he's simply going to claim her and they'll live happily ever after then he'd better think again.  Sure Becky loves him but she's stubbornly refusing to say the words, her change is taking longer than it should, and she's suddenly ailing and the doctor's diagnosis isn't fully explaining the odd symptoms.Dana Marie Bell writes this story with such humor and drama that I was quickly caught up in the romance between Becky and Simon and was unable to put this book down.  SWEET DREAMS is the second book in the HALLE PUMA series and flows beautifully from the first book WALLFLOWER.  Becky's feisty comments and loving nature really kept me chuckling and Simon seems to get a real kick out of her snappy comebacks.  I loved getting to know all of the characters in this story and they each quickly began to feel like treasured friends that I'll be happy to revisit many times in the future.I'll definitely be keeping an eye out for more Dana Marie Bell's books in the future.  This story was fun, whimsical and wholly satisfying.  I'd definitely recommend picking up the other books in the HALLE PUMA series as well.

He found out differently when Sheridan Montgomery comes to town.  She is the former college friend of Adrian's best friends and has come to ask for help in the form of joining the pack.  Oh did I mention that Adrian and his friends are puma shifters?While Sheridan has been a loner since she was changed, she needs help with a stalker (former boyfriend) who has gotten way out of hand.  When she meets Adrian her inner cat tells her that he is her mate.  But, she fights it as she knows her stalker will be a death threat to Adrian if he suspects that she is mated to him.Can the pack help Sheridan with her stalker?  Will Adrian and Sheri be able to overcome the obstacles and mate as nature wants them to?After reading Cat of a Different Color my first thought, was ooh interesting, I had never thought what would happen to a were animal that was an albino, and the challenges they might face.  Add to this the dynamic writing of Ms. Bell, her alpha male characters, and a woman being stalked, and you have a winning combination that pulled me in from the first page.

Gabe, like the dominant, alpha he is, decides that he doesn't need to mark Sarah and make their mating official until he gets back - he thinks the separation so soon after joining would be even harder on them.  Of course, this does not turn out to be the best course of action, since some stupid decisions on his part - including his close friendship with another female shifter in town who he manages to stay in touch with more often than his mate - as well as his giving said female friend jewelry as a Christmas present while he is home on leave and Sarah is away (Sarah thinks he didn't get her anything because he wants to give her her gift in person - of course he doesn't tell her this) - leave Sarah feeling abandoned and unloved for most of the 6 long and agonizing months that they are apart.

I found the characters to be very irritating especially Kir and Logan and Jordan's siblings. However I did like Jordan, she was the saving grace of this story.

Long hours are spent on scouting jobs for The Society, the elders and leaders of the vampire race.  This means Star has little time for fun and romance. Only one man has ever tempted her into yielding her heart, Lukas Montague, Commander of the Locke Brotherhood.The Locke Brotherhood is the Justice, the executioners and punishment for vampires who have gone rogue.  All vampires, no matter their status, answer to Lord de Vires, absolute ruler of the Vampire Nation.Astarla's and Lukas' destiny are intertwined; their decisions will affect the future.  Danger lurks everywhere and it will take all of their skills, cunning and the force of their love to help them to survive each challenge and every obstacle.Although the setting and characters are part of the preternatural world, The Empress and the Executioner is written in the distinct flavor I have come to associate with Jeanie Johnson in terms of character development, tone and narrative.  My largest complaint is the constant repetition of words and phrases, i.e. ""baby vamp"" that proved a bit distracting.Sadly, I failed to connect with Astarla and Lukas.  They are beautiful, tough and sexy, which fall short as distinguishing characteristics.  The sex is what I've come to expect in Ms. Johnson's stories, molten and hot enough to melt molding.  Action abounds but the descriptions are rushed and chopped off at the end of each scene.  Sometimes I felt like I missed something.  The constant shifts in perspective started to wear on me after awhile.  The third person jumps would occur in the same scene, which affected continuity and progress of the story.  That's not to say there weren't any enjoyable moments or characters.  The most intriguing individual was Lord de Vires.

I am not a big fan of the novella form- characters are usually one dimensional, stories seem rushed or overly simplistic and a little bit of background can read as dry as a law review when you are anxious to get back to the story. So I went into this expecting that. In the end, I found it didn't manage to avoid falling into those pitfalls, but I found I was pleased to have been introduced to the mythology of this world.This one was a little bit better than many novellas- the imagery is beautiful. Anyone who has spent time in a jungle would appreciate it. Very magical setting.The characters were not developed at all- I barely managed to put together a mental image of what they might look like, but the sex was hot and their attraction was palpable. Maggie and Brandt were likable enough, though you had to work hard to overlook his blatant deception that set off the whole thing. For the sake of the novella form, a reasonable back and forth between the two that would have allowed the relationship to develop had to be sacrificed. In places the passion short circuited rational thought, but Ms. Feehan managed to maintain the integrity of both characters.The best part of this, as I mentioned, was the mythology. Ms. Feehan has created a wonderful concept here. The environmental message was laid on a little thick, but overall it was a good concept to quickly win the heart of the reader.Anyone who is familiar with Ms. Feehan's work will recognize this isn't her best work, but it is a fast read that opens a door to a series that has great potential for passion.",Just the introduction...,Romance,Visit Amazon's Christine Feehan Page,The Awakening: The Novella That Introduced the Leopard People (Leopard series Book 1) - Kindle edition,14181.0,kindle,3.0

And I'll admit it, I wanted  WINTER WISHES solely for this story by Vivian Arend. I've been a fan of her ""Granite Lake Wolves Series"" (Wolf Signs: Granite Lake Wolves, Book 1) as well as several of her contemporary romances.  I didn't realize that I could get it by itself. But no worries, I enjoyed another story from a new author in the anthology.Undercover Cop El seduces cougar shifter Kyle and lures him to her room where she kidnaps him as part of an operation. She's been assigned to keep him hidden and secure until January court date. To keep him out of sight, she decides to take him to her sleepy hometown where nothing ever happens. Soon, Kyle brings out the cougar in El she's been trying to suppress in an attempt to fit into the human world and distance herself from things in the shifter world she's never liked.As I said before, I've followed Vivian Arend's Granite Lake Wolf Series and have read several of her other stories. I think I liked this story better than her wolf series--it may be because ""werewolves"" are so overdone that it's nice to have a different kind of shifter, or it may be because I really liked El and Kyle as well as the secondary characters.  The POV shifts between El and Kyle, but they never rehashed what just happened. If we saw a scene from El's POV we didn't have to suffer from seeing it again from Kyle's. The pacing was great, moving events along. I loved the character growth and how they both pushed each other to grow in unexpected ways.  I was disappointed by the ending, in that the case both Kyle and El were working on came to nothing and was all rather convoluted: it just seemed tacked on.  I am hopeful that we might see more from this world as Kyle has brothers and El has a TON of siblings. *crosses fingers*Word of caution: I would classify this story as erotica. Right off the bat, El flashes some bare skin at Kyle who then hunts her down to a changing room in a lingerie shop where they give the shop girls something to talk about. There is lots of sex, detailed and explicit.

It has all the ingredients to keep you captivated from start to finish : strong characters, a wonderful storyline, love and passion !Twelve years ago, the young and skinny Holt Langford was shipped off to the West Indies by his father like a crate of sugarcane.No one recognizes the tall dark haired man with a ponytail who enters the Langford mansion with dusty and old fashioned cloths ; well nearly nobody but her little sister Julia who was eight years old at the time he left.He has only come back to see his siblings after the death of his father and to take care of the family shipping business. He doesn't intend to remain in England and certainly not intend to take his title of Earl of Westover ! After living so long without restrictions of any kind he is afraid to find English society suffocating. All he wants is anonymity to serve his purpose and destroy once and for all their enemy, the Seacrest Family Shipping. There are bad blood and old family secrets between them.The easiest and quickest way to strike back is to ruin the eldest daughter's reputation. But never in a million years would he have imagined to experience such a reaction for the stunning and ardent Miss Sophie Seacrest. And indeed, as soon as they meet and touch, they catch fire ! His perfect plan begins to collapse and he becomes trapped between, his heart, his lie and the family feud.We have two strong characters here. Holt is very determined and he guards his heart. He was ripped off from his home at a young age and sent to an uncle who was a nasty piece of work. From that moment he buried all feelings and memories deep inside. There is no place for love in his life and so he is overwhelmed and afraid of what he feels for Sophie !Sophie is a lively and passionate young woman who is very determined too. She is reliable, sensible and is optimistic. She is a very intriguing mix. She adores her younger sister.It is a very well balanced story. All the secondary characters are very interesting and colorful and give a lot of depth to it ; there is a very good interaction between them.

When her friend Lisbeth takes her out in the guise of helping Jenna research for her book, the two of them embark on what at first looks like a typical girls' night out.On the surface this reads like a quirky, fun adventure but it really is a lot more than just another snarky-voiced romp. The setting is SO familiar. You're dragged into a situation where you're expected to mix and mingle and really every moment is like pulling teeth. There are the girls that seem to walk into a bar and they're dressed perfect, they look perfect, they even laugh perfectly and everyone seems to hang on their every word. That's Lisbeth. Then there's the rest of us. That's Jenna and that's what makes her so identifiable.I don't want to say too much about the plot since it's a short story, but one of the things I enjoyed about this story was it doesn't come off as superficial with a bunch of witticisms void of any true emotion or substance.

Oh, she can't see their faces -- only the deep green eyes of one of the robbers known only as Zeus.  But that is enough to intrigue her.  That and the fact that she hates the owners of the bank who are not very nice people.  So she decides to give them a helping hand.The beginning, when the bank robbery takes place is stellar.  It is really funny and the writing is quite zippy.  In fact, it was what sold me on the book.But the book takes a turn.  Frankly I wished the book had stayed funny and zippy.  My rating would have been higher.  As it is, the book gets a lot darker and much sexier. Through a series of events, Melinda is taken hostage and is part of the men's escape.  From there the book becomes a bit more of a typical erotica  sexxy-times story with Melinda quickly falling into a sexual menage with two of the three men.Zeus is the hold-out -- all growly and broody and snarly --  and you suddenly realize that the story isn't just about sexy-times hijinks anymore but has a deeper edge.Melinda becomes more and more involved not only with the guys sexually but also deeper into their shady business and the really, really dangerous people who are after them.While I do wish the book had stayed lighter, I think the author did a good job with taking the book into the darker route she did. There were points when I thought some of the plotting felt choppy and there was a element of woobification of Zeus re: the  reasons for his rejection of Melinda.But my biggest issue is with Melinda herself.  I know this is erotica and as such character motivation gets sacrificed on the altar of sex sometimes.  But still I think there was enough heft to the story that Melinda's easy and quick acceptance of both her assimilation into the gang and leaving her family behind felt careless and out of sync with some of the deeper emotions the story was trying to convey.  Sure Melinda thought about her sisters, but it felt uncomfortably like lip service at times.This is the first book of a multi-book arc following more adventures of the band of four.

Of course, if you're not used to very descriptive writers you may find her books hard to get into, but believe me, they are worth it.

It is one of her earlier books before she hit her stride as an author.  The book is enjoyable but predictable and doesn't have some of the strength of her later books (for example the Blossom Street series).The storyline is around Mary Warner, a librarian from Lousiana, who answers an ad for a wife.  Travis Thompson has placed the ad since his brother and sister-in-law have been killed in an accident and left him with their three children to raise.  He is in over his head trying to run his ranch in Montana and take care of three chilren, ages 5 - 12.  This book forces you to suspend any critical thinking about how unlikley the whole thing is if you want to enjoy the book.  There are lots of the predictable misunderstandings between the two as their relationship develops (very quickly, I might add) and passionate reconciliations.There is also very little sense of place in this story since it could have taken place in any rural setting in the United States.  In her later books, the descriptions of the locale play a large part in her stories and always add much to them.  The state of Montana could have provided interest in the story, but the opportunity was not capitalized upon.  The story is strictly romance and happy endings.Not bad -- read it in about 2 days -- but not up to the quality of her later books.

He was pleasantly surprised by Evelinde's beauty and luscious sweet lips.  Perhaps he might find marriage not so bad after all.***  The author never forgets to add a good dose of humor in her historicals and the original introduction of these two protagonists was indeed one of those memorable and delightful visions this talented wordsmith so ably produces. Not knowing who the hellion was, Cullen and his men's first vision of Evelinde galloping nearly naked with reins in her teeth waving cloth over head would tend to make one curious.  While their initial meeting was memorable, their wedding and mad dash to his keep and her first days with the `grumpy' laird was just  the great stuff one comes to expect from this author.Not that the entire story was filled with laugh out loud humor Ms. Sands also filled it with a sweetly wonderful romance, a bit of madness and harsh betrayal as Evelinde set out on her own to investigate the many murders and/or questionable accidents many tried to lay at the feet of her husband.  It didn't take Evelinde long to take the measure of Cullen and she knew without a doubt that beneath the gruff exterior lied a good gentle and honorable man!  Evelinde was wonderfully fleshed out and the story was mostly told from her point of view, which unfortunately didn't give a great deal of insight into Cullen even though this reviewer admired him greatly.The secondary cast of characters was fully sketched out and the true villain was pretty much a surprise although it did make sense as to why and who the culprit was if you paid attention to a couple of clues tossed out indiscriminately during the telling.If there were anything else I could have wished for  in this book was to see the how Evelinde's step-mother would have reacted to find Evelinde being loved and cherished by such a hunky handsome husband instead of beaten and bruised as she had wished for.Bottom line:  Another excellent read from an author who is right on top of my must buy lists - no matter what the genre!Marilyn Rondeau, [...]",Tops In Hysterical Historicals !,Romance,Visit Amazon's Lynsay Sands Page,Devil of the Highlands (Historical Highlands),282566.0,hardcover,4.83

It is a light read, in that there is no heart achingly events which cause very bitter characters, although one could argue the stepmother was abusive, yet the characters are not wholly scared.I purchased the audio version, and really enjoyed the narrators voice.

I love a story where the heroine is not your perfect supermodel skinny stick figure.Avelyn wants to be the perfect wife for Paen Gerville, but everything that can go wrong does, plus more. Avelyn believes herself to be too round and too fat and believes that her husband would prefer a slim girl. What she can't believe is that her husband wants a round wife to keep him warm at night. In Paen's eyes, Avelyn is just perfect and beautiful.The Perfect Wife is a great story that also has a lot of humorous moments. It is one of those light, fast reads that you can finish in a day.

Eighteen months had passed since her husband's sudden, mysterious death, and Emma had kept the knowledge of exactly how he'd died a secret, along with other events she dared not reveal.At least with Anthony's death she would finally be free. Now all Emma wanted to do was forget the past and adopt a quiet, decorous mode of living that would hopefully allow all the harsh rumors surrounding her to just fade away.But then her uncle comes to her and declares he has found her another husband, and she will shortly be a married woman again. His pronouncement leaves Emma trembling with dread as she has no desire to be a bride again; marriage had been a hideous experience for her and she didn't ever want to repeat it.As she sits contemplating what to do about her uncle's decree, lightening flashes in darkness outside the sitting room window; the stormy weather a grim parallel to Emma's turbulent emotions...She just can't do it, she could not marry again.She goes to the window and stares into the rainy night; and leaning her head against the glass in despair and desperation she utters a prayer into the darkness beyond, as she had done many times while married to Anthony... Please, God, save me...When an unfamiliar voice unexpectedly calls out her name, she turns to find a strange man standing in front of an open window across the room. The man was tall, dressed all in black, with striking features and an attractive face one would not easily forget. Her intruder cheekily smiles at her; and then has the audacity to demand the duchess give him the Tulloch Sg&agrave;th&aacute;n so he could return the valuable mirror to its rightful owners.Emma knew she very much needed a miracle. But God must truly work in mysterious ways, or have a unique sense of humor, if he had sent this handsome, arrogant rogue--the-most-unlikely-knight-in-shining-armor-ever--to come to her rescue.But luckily for Emma, Ian Hamilton McNair, Scottish Earl of Buchane, and Laird of Trelawny, is no ordinary brigand!*****Along with her customary dramatic flair and the smooth, sophisticated writing her readers have come to expect, in her newest historical romance, A HIGHLAND DUCHESS, New York Times and USA Today bestselling author, Karen Ranney delivers an intricately complex and powerfully stirring emotional tale of the beautiful young Duchess of Herridge... A woman who'd been traumatized during her marriage by the perverted desires of a husband who had forced her to endure acts of depravity guaranteed to crush the spirit, and defeat even the sturdiest of souls.And it's also the story of Lord Ian McNair, an intelligent and well regarded man of science.  A man who upon meeting the Duchess is mesmerized by Emma's beauty--by expressive eyes that fascinated him, and spoke of untold secrets hidden in their blue depths. They revealed a strong woman of intelligence and wry humor, along with glimpses of darker, more painful emotions she struggled to hide. Ian doesn't care about the rumors surrounding the woman they call the Ice Queen.  But can he convince Emma that he'll never hurt her? That he only wants to be the man that melts the ice around her heart, eases her pain, and helps her to heal.  Beyond that, he's determined to be the only man she turns to for comfort, for the safety and sanctuary found in his strong, protective arms... and for the fiery passion in his tender, loving touch.I loved Ian and felt he was a deliciously charismatic hero. He's a man great of intelligence, and a dependable, responsible, and undeniably honorable man. I liked that he was inquisitive by nature and eager to gain knowledge about the workings of the world around him and studied the biological sciences to help people. That he was smart and playfully roguish, added to his appeal, and fortunately, he was a much better scientist than a thief.  He penetrated the barriers Emma had erected around her heart and mind with his offer of friendship, with a willingness to listen, to understand, and not to judge her, for the actions of her husband.  And from Ian's personal dilemma, we also learn that when you don't love someone ... sometimes the greatest kindness you can do for them, is not doing what some people consider the honorable thing. Especially if by doing it you open that person up to a lifetime of emotional heartache, knowing their love isn't returned.And I loved how the author gradually built up the sexual tension between Ian and Emma as their attraction and desire for each other grew. It felt extremely honest and believable, and the love scenes were both thrilling and intensely sensual.Karen Ranney is a supremely accomplished writer and consummate storyteller. She crafts deeply emotional stories that are always engaging, passionate, and utterly romantic, and her poignant, inspiring and ever hopeful themes are guaranteed to tug at your heartstrings.  She also has a remarkable ability to seamlessly weave relevant historical data into a thoroughly compelling and eloquent told narrative. In A Highland Duchess, the author delves into the darker underside of Victorian life and morals in a way that is insightful, penetrating and fascinating; by subtly revealing that society's secrets, rumors and innuendo for the unpleasant and disgraceful truths they sometimes were. It essentially challenges the widely popular view that Victorian culture was exclusively characterized by strong moral principles, propriety, personal restraint, family values and excessive formality. A closer look at history tells us that wasn't always the case.I thought Emma was a superbly drawn character. She was tired of being the Duchess of Herridge, of being the cold dispassionate Ice Queen, though that was what had helped her survive, but she wanted to wipe the memories of it all from her mind... and be simply Emma the woman. And she wanted to feel healthy, honest desire and fiery passion for a man, for Ian, and to be a willing participant in their love making without any regrets, or the terrible shame and humiliation she suffered through with Anthony's lewd debaucheries.I felt so much compassion for her, I wanted to cry for the heartache and misery she'd suffered. Her story gives you a hint of what life may truly have been like in the 1860's for woman, and how they were at the complete mercy of their fathers or husbands or uncles or brothers. Life was not always all pleasantries and tea parties for women, even the wealthy ones.This is a story of two good, decent and honorable people, who were brought together by an extraordinary twist of fate. In the beginning they were two wholly different people... Emma was a wounded Duchess hiding from life, and Ian, a scientist who embraced life in all its wonder and glory. But together they'll learn that love truly can mend a broken heart... and... ""WHEN THE HEART WAS OPENED TO LOVE, LIFE CHANGED.""This is a richly detailed, wonderful story...

Her books have these brow-beaten women who are tortured by their circumstances and somehow come out the other side stoic yet with a happily ever after in the arms of a handsom man??  It's just too unrealistic based on the horrible things she writes -- it is much more likely that the women would either run away or kill themselves, but instead they just sit there and allow themselves to be tortured and then LAMENT about it for pages and pages.  Ummm...no.  These aren't romances.  If anything, it is the anti-Austen novel, where life sucks and you don't even get to die.  Oh, but don't worry ladies, some guy will sleep with you and make it all better.  Sorry, but that's just not the way it works, especially when you've been sexually abused.Don't get me wrong.  I love a romance where the hero swoops in and saves the heroine too, but if that is what she is going for, she should tone down the atrocities that happen to the heroine.  Sexual assault or physical or psychological torture aren't going to be fixed by a good shag and it isn't romantic to think so.  Instead, it's unrealistic and sad.

When she arrives, she is drugged and is about to be raped by a circle of lecherous men when she is suddenly rescued by a man visiting the group to ask about a magical mirror. The man, Montgomery Fairfax is an American Civil War hero, who has just inherited the title Lord Fairfax and Doncaster Hall, a beautiful estate in the Scottish Highlands. When he returns Veronica home, clad only in his cloak, her uncle the earl insists that Montgomery marry her. So he does, taking her to Scotland. Haunted by the ghosts of his past and not wanting a wife, he pays her little attention to Veronica except in bed. Veronica, on the other hand, is happy to be away from her miserable family and back in her beloved Highlands and vows to become a good wife. Montgomery has little desire to be the lord of a going concern and wants only to continue his scientific endeavor to develop a steering mechanism for his hot air balloons he worked on during the war.I can't tell you why this story never grabbed me. But it didn't. Once they were in Scotland, not much seemed to happen outside of ordinary life. Perhaps that was it. I didn't like her family who visited them (she didn't either). Also, the ""black moment"" where he thought she might be behind a plot to do him harm seemed contrived. All that detracted from what might have been a better story. Certainly she writes very well and the concept was novel for which I give her full marks. But I'm rating it as 3 and 1/2 stars. If you are a Ranney fan, you likely won't be disappointed.

If you are interested, there is no profanity in this novel but there is one section where multiple sexual interludes take place.  This author uses the minimum of descriptive prose for them, as in the ""burning loins"" variety.  They don't exactly take place off the page, but the reader is left to fill in as much imaginative information as they individually prefer.Why this series is called The Brides of Wishmore is a mystery to me since I don't remember any reference to Wishmore.  However, according to the notation inside this book the next novel in the series will be called The Bride Says Maybe.  Could it possibly be that the third title would be something like The Bride Says Yes?  If you are already a fan of Ms. Maxwell's writing I think this would be something you would want to read.",And........this reader says no.,Romance,Visit Amazon's Cathy Maxwell Page,The Bride Says No: The Brides of Wishmore,326558.0,hardcover,4.0

Facing extinction as they struggle against escalating Antarean attacks, the proud warrior race begins the process of uniting with the Galactic Alliance to ensure their future.Captain Wulf Caradoc, as the heir of the Prime leader, is expected to assist with negotiations on behalf of his people.  The secret, secondary part of his agenda is to look for his gemate, the genetically ideal mate that will be bonded to him mentally, physically and emotionally until the end of his days.  The ambassadorial team he is assigned to escort is attacked by space pirates hired by Prime malcontents.  Despite their skillful defense tactics, Wulf, his crew, and their charges are in danger until Alliance forces can reach them.Captain Melina Dmitros is a top-notch Galactic Alliance officer who's paid her dues.  After receiving a distress message from the Prime ambassador party, she steps in to aid them.  When she finally meets the future Prime leader face-to-face, she is ambushed by the biological force of the Prime mating urge.  She is his gemate, his fated match and a Lost One.  Her body will not allow her to survive without him, regardless of how she feels.  Wulf is willing to do whatever it takes to claim and protect his mate so that they may persevere against their enemies.The action kicks up a dust storm in chapter one of Prime Obsession that never settles!  I was convinced that Captain Dmitros was a first-rate adrenaline junkie from all the non-stop battles.  I rarely encounter a novel with multiple action scenes per interval.  Melina takes on bad guys, dodges hits, sniffs out/repairs sabotages, and keeps time with her man.  It's all in a day's work for a woman that knows her way around the Prime as well as the Galactic Alliance.  Wulf is growls and nibbles when it comes to his mate, although he's more than earned his formidable Prime warrior and sex machine title.  However, Melina is always center stage and in the thick of it all.  I started to feel that she was beginning to upstage her man.  Ok, ok.  Admittedly, I do prefer strong, accomplished female antagonists.  Still, Melina proved a bit overwhelming at times.Wulf's growling seemed uh, well...ridiculous after a while.  I've read novels with alpha males expressing their protectiveness this way, yet the constant repetitiveness became excessive and silly after a while.  Of course, it was a relief to have Wulf take charge after watching Melina prove just how tough and skilled she is over and over again. I could better appreciate the developing relationship.  The author does an amazing job of revealing the awakening gifts from a gemat-gemate pairing. Once I got a grasp on the dynamic, it was okay for the plot to charge ahead.Prime Obsession is a fast-paced space opera outfitted in shiny new gadgets and modern characters.  If you're looking for a sci-fi novel brimming with loads of techno jargon, intergalactic intrigue and angst, you've come to the right place.  Melina and Wulf's chemistry decimates small planets.  The ""foreplay"" preceding their first time together behind closed doors covers way too much ground; it dangled on the storyline string a tad longer than I would have preferred.  The romance and dialogue occasionally feels dated, although I could appreciate some truly cute moments.  Monette Michaels' narrative style is clean and precise with crisp visuals that flow easily from scene to scene.  All in all, it's fun to be kept on the edge of your seat for the bulk of the ride.  That's no easy feat in a story with so many subplots and secondary characters.  If this is just the first installment, then the next episode will have to put in some major overtime to keep up.PatriceReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",Prime Obsession,Science Fiction & Fantasy,Visit Amazon's Monette Michaels Page, Prime Obsession (The Prime Chronicles Book 1) eBook,72413.0,kindle,4.0

A  holy friar, a poet, a beautiful epileptic girl and an amnesiatic Knight Templar set out to reclaim the Holy Grail from Lucifer.

Yet it is not just the inventiveness of this story that sets Devil's Lair apart, it is the incredible craftsmanship shown by the author. It is evident that he loves language - English, Latin, Greek. It is evident that his grasp of Medieval history is impeccable (or so it seemed to me). It is evident that his understanding of the Church, the superstitions and the science of the time is beyond reproach. But it is his natural storytelling ability that quite simply makes this book a work of art. Not once was I distracted by Mr. Wisehart's knowledge.

Among them, they assembled a massive fleet of a thousand ships, and prepared to descend on Troy to retrieve the straying wife.Now, Agamemnon had previously insulted the goddess Artemis, so she becalmed the ships in the harbor until Agamemnon should offer the life of his oldest daughter, Iphigenia, to appease the insult.  To lure the girl there for the sacrifice, Agamemnon sent a message that she was to come to be married to the hot hero, Achilles.  He hadn't expected that his wife, Clytemnestra, would insist on attending her daughter's wedding.This short story takes place mostly in Iphigenia's head during that period, with occasional flashbacks to her earlier life.

At 149 pages, it was succinct, suitably written with a clear concept from start to finish.We follow the story of Ava Delaney, a willowy red-head living on the brink of society. She hides from human interaction, fearful of the dark seed that blooms within. She is what the vampires call a hybrid - half human, half vampire, otherwise known as a day-walker. She craves fresh blood, a constant, aching need that drives her virtually crazy, her only form of calm is to count - count the heartbeat of a would-be victim.Ava hates the very essence of herself, determined to avoid human contact and beat the burning thirst within. Unfortunately, in trying to avoid and or help the very thing that her vampiric side covets, she winds up with a thrall - a human called Carl, a poor soul lost to her very whims.The book sees her explore her nature to extent, remaining true to her protective instincts and urge to help those who cannot help themselves. I enjoyed her consistency and the writer's ability to stay on track with topics - a clear cut story line with inevitability in keeping with the character's chosen paths.Despite this novella being perfectly on target for flow of interpretation, I felt slightly cheated by lack of descriptive content. Sometimes it was hard to picture certain characters, grasp their moods, or envisage the scenes when the novella only allows so much time for detail.The story itself was built on basic subject matter, a blossoming introduction in which the author makes very clear that there is definitely more to Ava Delaney. The action was plentiful, though brief as every other aspect of this novella projects, and I must admit, I am a little curious to see if this relatively sedate girl will unfurl into a dangerous vixen. At least, I certainly hope so.I rate this book three out of five fangs.

This is not a Zombie story, but something a whole lot better.  The premise is this: For years a drug was taken by everyone who had a psychologial  / mental health issue.  The long term effects were not known and after some years, many of those who had been taking the drug 'presented' with wildly enhanced symptoms of what they were trying to suppress, resulting in all sorts of abnormal behaviours in people coming out of the woodwork.  Look out for those obsessive-compulsives in particular who will be more than a little upset if you mess with their routines and rituals.Captain Joe Boland, and overweight drunk, was one of those who had to help clean up the mess 'back in the day'.  Now, 20 years after the ""Variant Effect"" was supposed to have been cleaned out, there is a new outbreak.  The government is dragging the men and women who helped contain the Variant Effect the first time out of retirement to lead a Sneak Team to find out what the hell is going on.The background story is very well set up and the use of jargon and military terms is so well done that it becomes second nature.  I found myself really getting into this book and thinking what a geat movie it would make.  The author is not too scared to kill off characters and it is certainly no walkover when the Sneak Team meets up with those who have 'presented'.I'm looking forward to finding others in the series.","Great Horror Book.

It feels like the story starts in the middle, as we have a lot of exposition at the start.  It felt like I was buried with names and events, right from the beginning.  Frankly, it felt like I started with Volume 2 by accident.  There was a lot of stuff thrown at the audience, right away.  I would have preferred that, as these events were important, I would have like to have seen them from the start, not shoved at me in a bunch.Lusiraadrol - I like this villain, and actually felt sorry for her.  Which I probably wasn't supposed to.  She was touched before birth by the Ultimate Evil in this world.  She's also trapped in a foreign, inferior form.  I also think she's doomed in the end, once the Big Bad, manifests fully.Vahrik - ugh, now there is a pathetic villain.  But, I think he's supposed to be, so well written.Istaria - Unfortunately, I get distracted by the name, as it's the name of a computer game that I used read about on forums (originally Horizons, now knows as Istaria).  Certainly got my attention, but kept showing up as the character spoke.Gaispar - another character I liked, determined and loyal.The Dragons - These are a mixed bag to me.  They are invulnerable, but at the same time, extremely vulnerable in two spots.  So, you can't hurt them, unless you know the secret, then they die pretty quick.  If you knew your dragons had this vulnerability, wouldn't you as Lusiradrol do something about it?  I also don't like that the good dragons are larger than the evil dragons.  Makes the villains less imposing.  I also hate the good dragons only talking in rhyme.  Doesn't sound mysterious to me, just sounds annoying.I do appreciate the little drakes.

I do like this book, but there is still so much I don't understand, I don't really understand how the two races (the Mishnese and Karupta) came to their planet, I don't understand why they've been fighting for a thousand years, and why in the world would a King allow his prince to act a fool. I mean come on real that sucker in. There is a lot that happens in this book, and maybe starting out the way I did wasn't the best way to begin this but, that really does bother me. With all that we come to know and all that we come to understand there are still so many questions. I guess that's why this is a series. This book follows Senya but never through Senya's voice, we follow all the people around him, and not always sequentially, which can be confusing. Each chapter is someone different, though not always a different voice. Sometimes we move forward and sometimes backward but the central focus is always Senya. I mean he is pretty magnificent, he is apparently great to look at and he has magical powers, and weird feet. I wouldn't say there is a lot of action in this book, there is some but mostly it's a lot of internal dialogue and interaction. We are getting to know a boy without ever getting in his head but we never really get to know him very well. He's ever-changing a dynamic, and quiet character. I think if you don't like wordy or character driven stories then you may not like this, but the author does a great job in helping us visualize this world. Overall the book is very entertaining and each voice we hear, is different and unique to that person. We span many years through this book and though it's not always fluid, it is still very entertaining.

I loved the Demon Girl series and I can see the growth in Ms. Fletcher as a writer as I like this dragon series even more. Ms. Fletcher is deconstructing a fairy tale here and it is riveting. The dragons in this book live in a brutal world which is on the cusp of evolving. Of course our heroine Marina is just the shove it needs. I am not a fan of plot summaries in lieu of an actual opinion of a book. Here's mine: the characters were extremely well drawn, caricature was used for comic relief and well done as in the case of Nicholai.

Fighting is to the death and killing your intended's family to use as bait is acceptable.

It is this constant flux of the epic and ordinary, the personal and godlike, the wry and portentous that makes this book so unique and enjoyable.Those previously acquainted with other Zelazny works may find this the quintessential Zelazny novel in its combining so many of his themes:  the mythological element done better here than in hisThis Immortal,eye of Cat, and Creatures of Light and Darkness; the political machinations of the Amber books; the tough guy, behind the scenes manipulator familiar fromMy Name Is Legion; the martial arts ofRoadmarks; the interest in psychology as inThe Dream Master (The Nebula Award-Winning Novel).Two slight warnings.  First, don't expect any profound commentary on any of the religions that show up in this book.  Second, the first chapter of this book may be tough going for some readers - particularly when the Buddha delivers a sermon.  The book's momentum and comprehensibility picks up after that as there is a long set of chapters showing the back story with the final chapter resuming the action with a new understanding by the reader.This is one of those books that fully deserves its place in the canon of great science fiction.","A Classic Story of the Epic and Ordinary, Godlike and Personal",Science Fiction & Fantasy,Visit Amazon's Roger Zelazny Page,Lord of Light,27369.0,hardcover,4.17

The world is one of ancient religions, literal god-like beings, and advanced technology hiding under the mask of supernatural power.  I will not spoil the story but will only say that it is told on an epic Lord of the Rings type scale.  The allusions to Eastern philosophy and religion is pretty awesome too.  For a sci-fi novel the characters were pretty good.  They weren't great like in a Dostoevsky novel, but they weren't completely one-dimensional as is the case in too many sci fi novels.

687,59239,59239,45020,A1Z2GBQXPAAPMN,0060567236,Joe Boudreault,2.0,2011,"Okay, the 1960s were a crazy, drug-oriented counterculture time of the last century. That may explain why this novel won a 1968 Hugo Award for the best novel, and also was nominated for the Nebula Award too. I still shake my head over this. Let me explain:I loved some of the short stories of Roger Zelazny from the 50s and 60s. In my effort to read the list of novels that are actual winners of these awards, I finally got to this thing. Lord of Light is a glitzy and rambling tale of the battle of the titans on a faraway Earth-like world where a bunch of super-powered beings fight it out over the control of the lesser inhabitants of their world. Immediately you get to be totally immersed in the pantheon of the Hindu gods and their nefarious deeds everywhere. Reading this novel is like being transported into some magical age of the Indian continent, date unspecified. The battles and devious plans of these semi-divine creatures is everywhere, on every page. It is as if Zelazny decided: what if the age of the Hindu gods was brought to life and we saw what they were doing. It is as if a mixture of Norse mythology, Greek mythology, Easterm mythology and so on was churned up and vomited forth to the reader.My contention is that Zelazny must have being doing some drugs and wanted to be a part of that drug-crazed decade (the 1960s) and he splashed the entire novel with cosmic battles and unlikely and bizarre reunions of these so-called deities. In a word, this is a fantasy novel very thinly disguised as a sci-fi novel. And I am not a fantasy fan at all. To top it all off, this is very confusing and pell-mell story telling, if it can even be called that. There are hints here and there that this is a fallen world of colonists (mention is made of the `Firstlings'...) in which a few of these human rulers have made themselves into gods with their technology and set up their various mythological kingdoms. We have scenes of `gods' sitting around and smoking and drinking and plotting their next moves. We have various battles involving lasers and magic machines and we have the transformation of people's minds and personalities into donor bodies (ie Aspects and Attributes of the gods!). But it all doesn't click.This would have been a decent idea if developed in a sensible way. If Zelazny had presented the reader with a world where normal humans struggled to regain their rightful place among these god-like terrorist rulers and learned that the gods were mere humans with special technology. But Zelazny bombards us with mythology and the playful war games of the Hindu pantheon until we are numbed and confused and there is no reality but to think that these are real gods. Ho hum. It is very poorly done and not at all convincing. I suggest (seriously) that even the judges of this tripe of a novel were also on the same pantheon of mind-altering drugs as was (likely)  the author Roger Zelazny. It was a common thing in the 1960s, remember. Sorry, Roger, but this is in no way a brilliant novel, not even a half-good one.It is worth noting that in that same year of 1968, there were a few other novels of far superior quality. Piers Anthony had given us Chthon, a riveting story of a prison planet, and Samuel R Delany had also been nominated for his perceptive look at a post-apocalyptic world in The Einstein Intersection; and also we had Philip K Dicks wonderful tale of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? And not to forget John Brunner's compelling and truthful Stand On Zanzibar or the poignant winner by Alexei Panshin, Rite Of Passage. Etc etc, all of this in that same weird year just before the fantasy-like fact of the first moon walk (which received a special Nebula award in 1969).Notwithstanding the fact Zelazny is a fine writer in most respects, a choice like this for award material truly puzzles me. This is the world of sci-fi in its best mode and Lord Of Light is the world of fantasy in a poor light. But as I said, I am not a fantasy literature fan.

He has also given his colonists-turned-gods various names and nicknames, so one may get lost during the first reading and due  to his attempt to follow the story, may miss the fine writing which would be a big shame.Is there a better one on one fighting scene than the one between Sugata and Yama in the middle of the novel?The fight in the book This Immortal between Conrad and the robot is perhaps the one that tops this one. Not accidentally, This Immortal was also written by Zelazny.Is the Lord of Light a novel of despair or hope?It depends on your understanding of it. Personally, regardless of the way the novel ends, I find it disturbing, because, out of the possible hundreds of thousands of possible future transmutations of the human race, the one Zelazny describes is one of the plausible ones.Why is Lord of Light not as popular, as let's say, Dune?It's not linear and as said above, it demands a second reading. However, I am pretty certain that is one of the most popular second reading novels in the world.Almost, half a century after its publication, can nowadays majority of Hugo winners and nominees be compared to Lord Of Light?This has to be answered with the initials of Zelazny's novel: LOL.",Q & A,Science Fiction & Fantasy,Visit Amazon's Roger Zelazny Page,Lord of Light,27369.0,hardcover,4.17

Apparently, fans get served fish n' chips wrapped in newspapers.  Then, instead of going to the restroom, they roll up the paper and pee in it... then discard it at their feet.  The theory goes that the scent of all this urine sets off an animal reaction that causes fighting.

After being traitorously sold to an enemy fleet as a galley slave, a newly freed Cazaril returns home with the hopes of settling down in the warm lap of obscurity. But fate, as it happens, has other plans.The Curse of Chalion tells his tale.This novel is one of the most engaging, exciting reads in the genre. And not only that, LMB knows how to write. (Some might find her style a bit mannered, perhaps, but I think that it suites the delicate, elegant world that she has built.) And she knows how to craft a character. Cazaril is a real human being in a real world. (So if you're looking for Harry Potter, or Kvothe, or Superman, you'll be sorely disappointed; Cazaril is as flawed and faulted as any of us and his magic entails far more than waving a silly wand around and saying some magic words.) His story begins modestly, to protect and train the young Royesse Iselle for a position of power, and slowly, ever so slowly, becomes a quest to save the royal House of Chalion and the Kingdom itself . . . .Edit 30 June 2014: I have since purchased this book, as an audio book, through Audible. Even better, if such a thing is possible. If our young people could take Cazaril as a model, as opposed to all these moronic ""chosen ones"" (funny how there are, like, a thousand ""chosen one's"" eh?), we would all be better off.

The story follows Cazaril going from barely above being a vagabond to servicing as secretary and advisor to the young, yet intelligent princess of Chalion.  Then Cazaril is forced to going to the royal court and soon finds that not only is he having to protect his charge and himself from human enemies of all kinds, but also the supernatural due to the actions of the a previous King but Cazaril himself.The world in which the story takes place is thoroughly thought from the political to the religious, societally from the royal court down to the peasant struggling to survive.  From the start the religious and magical system Bujold built as an integral part of her world just grabs the reader in it's familiar elements to Christianity and New Age concepts, but also it's uniqueness and originality.  But when the reader experiences the realm of The Five, Bujold writes it like a mystical experience that it's hard for a mere mortal to explain in words and the reader experiences that difficulty along with Cazaril.The sole issue I have with the story is the somewhat creepiness in the relationship between Cazaril and Lady Betriz, and the somewhat annoying trope of men not getting the signals from women that tends to invade many genres.  However, the story isn't a romance and thus these &#34;issues&#34; don't really take away from the overall story.&#34;The Curse of Chalion&#34; is a must read for any fantasy reader, it's highly recommended and now one of my favorite books.",Simply Awesome,Science Fiction & Fantasy,Visit Amazon's Lois McMaster Bujold Page,The Curse of Chalion (Chalion series),80004.0,hardcover,5.0

The epic scope of the mythology that he created, those memorable events that we shall never forget and how he crafted his work within our own historical timeline never fails to neither astound me nor leave me in awe of his achievements. There is so much more depth behind the stories that we cherish and love (such as The Silmarillion, The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit), and which can be partially discovered within the history of how it all came into being.In the first section Christopher Tolkien completes his lengthy, fascinating study of the Lord of the Rings, beginning with Sam rescuing Frodo when he is held captive by the enemy in the tower of Cirith Ungol. It also gives a very different insight into the Scouring of the Shire and ends with the Epilogue that was never published - in which Sam attempts to answer his children's questions when Bilbo and Frodo have departed from the Grey Havens.In the second section of the book, is an edition of the `Notion club papers' which are now published for the first time. These mysterious papers discovered in the early years of the twenty-first century report the discussions of an Oxford club in 1986 and 1987, in which subject matter turns to the legends of Atlantis amongst other interesting topics. There is also a new version of the `drowning of Anadn (continuing into the third part of this book). At this time the language of the men of the West, Adnaic, was first devised and the book concludes with an account of its structure provided by Arundel Lowdham (a member of the Notion club, who learned it in his dreams).For anyone wishing to learn more about JRR Tolkien's epic creation and the stories, the inspiration and the detailed, extensive history behind Middle-Earth I highly recommend that you read this series of books that explore and reveal so much.

As soon as I finished it I ran to my local bookstore to get the next one in the series. I have since read the trilogy numerous times.The story is set in a city called Imardin, the capital of Kyralia. During the purge (The annual purging of the city streets of the poor into the slums) the protagonist, Sonea, throws rocks at the local magicians. When one of the stones passes through the magical barrier, panic abounds. Sonea goes into hiding believing that if the magicians catch her they will kill her because they do not want the poor to be magicians in their guild. Meanwhile the magicians begin a search, intending to offer her a place among them. And so begins the story.The story just keeps getting better as you read it, which is saying something as the start is so captivating. The personalities of the characters just jumped off the page. My favourite by far was, of course, Sonea. Such a strong leading lady was a rare thing in books I read when I first read this series. She is a woman who chooses the way she wants to live without concerning herself with the opinion of others. She makes her own decisions, though didn't have many options when in hiding. There was not much character growth over the course of the book, but remember this is a trilogy with growth in all of the characters spread out across all three books.For me to truly love a book it usually has to have at least a dash of romance without completely taking over the story. If there is no romance at all I'm usually not going to give it a great review. I think it truly goes to show how amazingly good this book is that there was no romance in it and yet I still LOVED it! The romance comes later in the books, and is done amazingly well. It is up there with my all-time favourite romances. Even later on in the trilogy the romance is still just a sub plot and not the main focus of the books. Everything would have played out exactly the same without the romance, I think. But oh am I glad it's in there!Trudi Canavan's writing style was paced very well. She is a truly exceptional story teller. I have read every book she has ever had published, and while I didn't enjoy them quite as much as The Black Magician series, I did still love reading them.I loved the characters I was meant to love, hated those I was meant to hate, and was curious about those meant to be mysterious.

I would most definitely recommend this book, indeed the series, to anyone looking for a truly mesmerising read. If you have the money to buy it, or even a library to order it, then go get it now!

You would then think if a chase scene was described in 190 pages, then it must be some awesome adventurous heartfelt chase.  Nope, not in this book.Sonea was a slump girl who accidentally discovered that she had magical power during the annual Purge of the city.  She threw a stone and ""willed"" it through the magical protective barrier and hit one of the magicians.  Since she was untrained and her power was uncontrolled, the magicians in the kingdom were vowed to locate her before she killed herself and destroyed the whole city.  However, fearing for condemnation, Sonea went in hiding and eluded the search with the help of her childhood friend.Now imagine this hide-and-seek plot stretched into 190 pages.  And during the whole time, there were absolutely no character developments what-so-ever.  Each character stayed the same and as flat as can be.  By the time Sonea was finally found and on the brink of destroying herself and the city, I really don't give a hoot to anyone anymore.Now that Sonea was found and brought to the Magician Guild, you would think there must be some excitement, right?  At least there should be lots of magic casting around, right?  Wrong!  The second half of the book described Sonea's life in the Magician Guild, and how she distrusted the magicians and disapproved their way of living.  It talked a little about how she started doing magic and controlling it, but the whole plot was still very dull and flat.  The story did spark a little when the sole villain, Lord Fergun, was trying to do something.  But unfortunately it didn't have enough weight to redeem the book.Don't waste your money and time on this book.","Run ...

The Guild, as the dwells (the lower class) see it, are dangerous and greedy, pushing them around and only using their abilities for helping the rich. They know, above all else, to steer clear of magicians. Which wouldn't be too difficult, except that Sonea has magic too, strong, untrained magic that the Guild has discovered and cannot let go uncontrolled.A part of me felt like this book (the first one in a trilogy) took too long to get going. There was too much running and hiding from the Guild and not enough actual magic, for my taste. Not that the story was bad, it just felt a bit redundant. But, being a series involving magic and lessons, it ultimately held my attention despite the meandering start.I don't think the different characters were as well developed as they could have been and I disliked the fact that a number of them seemed to disappear halfway through the book. We got to know some people and then never saw them again, which is frustrating and even a bit disappointing.But what the book lacked in character, it made up for in world and plot twist.

It reads as if it is part ghost story, part science fiction (quantum physics -- two souls popping up in an alternate reality, ala THE HOLLOW MAN).  And the narrator -- a teacher who suffered from alcholism -- is a suitably flawed man.  As he traverses the strange, almost otherwordly landscape -- which seems to have been created by both himself and his former student, Kelly -- it becomes apparent that there may have been something going on between himself and the teenage girl (there's even a sort of homage to ""The Most Dangerous Game"").Dynamite story, in which Simmons proves that he was still able to tug the heart strings of the reader while telling a fantastic tale.2)""Orphans of the Helix"": actually a pretty fun, space opera story.  And it has a _great_, scary machine-thing (shades of Star Trek -- 1960s version) that threatens the space ship on which the ""intersellar pilgrims"" are travelling.  But it stutters in a few places, and one gets the sense that it's because the author cobbled up this ""sequel"" (to his ""Hyperion"" and ""Endymion"" novels) due to the clamor of his fans, and a desire to be included in a really cool anthology (FAR HORIZONS).3) ""The Ninth of Av"": This one is interesting solely because it is a sort of prequel to ILIUM and OLYMPOS (the first of which was terrific; the second, well...).  Mostly, this story seems to exist for one reason and one reason alone: as polemic.  Jews good, muslims bad.  That's as deep as the thought behind this piece gets.  Sort of a precursor to the extraordinarily wrong-headed dreck that Simmons eventually turned out on his website during the height of Bush/Cheney popularity.  Yeech.4) ""On K2 With Kanakaredes"":  A bit of sci-fi fluff cobbled up to fill yet another slot in yet another anthology.  The sad thing is: the author wants us to believe that an advanced race which travels across great expanses of space and time can't find a good mountain of their own to climb back on their home world.  Oy.5)  ""The End of Gravity"": This is a good outline in search of some prose.  Basically: filler material.""Kelly Dahl"" is excellent, and thus rates one star.  But of the other four, only ""Orphans"" rated half a star (the others, not so much).  Still can't do half a star in these ratings, so I'm going with the one.**FINALLY NOTE, added long after ther review was written: This regards the story,""The Ninth of Av"" and an polemic essay that Simmons wrote around 2003, 2004 or so (about a ""time traveler"" who comes from the future to warn the author of a time when Muslims control the world, or some such craziness): I've seen endless speculation on discussion forums by fanatical followers of Dan Simmons's writing, and in all of them (that I checked a while back -- maybe someone has wised up), ALL of his devoted readers had NO CLUE as to the what the three words Simmons mentions in his crazy ""essay-cum-story"". Given that they are so devoted to his fiction, it's surprising none of them (at least when I last stumbled across one of those slavish ""gatherings"") never noticed that the answer to their query lies within ""The Ninth of Av"": the three words, spoken in arabic, are even mentioned in Simmon's introduction to this story.  Perhaps it speaks to how little some of them really understand what it is, exactly, that they are reading.

Although all five tales have a sci-fi feel to them, they are not stories for the comic book, Star Wars kind of crowd. Forget about hoping that these are edge-of-your-seat pieces that will compel you to keep turning the pages. I find Mr. Simmons' work to be enjoyable simply because of his writing style. If you're looking for a Wild West, shoot-'em-up, political intrigue collection... BOY!... have you picked up the wrong book. The major problem with this volume had to do with the introductions before each story. I enjoyed seeing a little behind the author's curtain on how each story came to fruition, but it did take away some of the element of surprise and wonder that I find important in reading any story. Also, I'm a pretty well-read individual, but with the exception of a few people like Stephen King and Shakespeare, Mr. Simmons' interspersion of various authors he has read or admires were strangers to me.

It definitely has a ""Traveller"" feel to it, as per the author's background with that role playing game, and the technology presented is well vetted, but it seems more to be tailored to present to the reader an allegory of modern carriers put in space, as opposed to what the author thinks a real space carrier with fighters might do; i.e. how it might be used and otherwise employ its forces.The prose is okay, but there's a lack of grounding and reference.  A real lack of texture to the prose, and that's a real shame.  Some of the planetary scenes are okay, but the space battles and shipboard scenes leave much to the imagination.  We aren't painted a picture as we should be, but are presented an abstract reality with events that we're supposed to sink our teeth into.It really doesn't work for me, and I found it difficult to get through due to that aspect.  The aliens were painted as unique, but here again, for all of their intellect, they seemed to be really dim in the strategic and tactical department, which I suppose was intentional because the humans need some kind of edge, right?I hate to say it, but it almost read like a sci-fi novel from the 1950s.

My enjoyment of these archetypal tales certainly precedes their current trendiness.  I've encountered both classic and contemporary fairy tales as significant elements of novels like Kate Morton'sThe Forgotten Gardenand Lisa Goldstein'sThe Uncertain Places, plays like Stephen Sondheim'sInto The Woods, and of course, any number of recent films and television shows.  I thought I had a reasonably good working knowledge of the lore, but Philip Pullman's Fairy Tales from the Brothers Grimm has proved me wrong.The book includes an even fifty tales.  Pullman's done the research, collecting various iterations of each story and distilling it to its essence.  He has written his definitive version of the tale with a contemporary readership in mind.  Each of the tales is no more than a few pages long, and each features a brief (and surprisingly academic) afterward by the author.  I found these endnotes to be especially interesting, whether about the tales' origins, the literary choices he had made, or the differing versions of the story.Some of these fairy tales will be familiar to all readers--though perhaps not every element.  In Rapunzel, for instance, she is indeed entreated, ""Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair.""  However, I have no recollection of Rapunzel becoming an unwed mother.  Surely that wasn't in the Disney version?Many of these tales were completely unfamiliar to me.  I was thrilled, however, to recognize a version of the tale Pullman calls The Twelve Brothers in a novel I read recently.  (I'm sorry, I can't remember which.)  It's a small thing, but I was so utterly delighted to have new a new familiarity with the source material.Personally, I didn't feel the need to read this collection cover to cover.  Rather, I read two or three fairy tales between novels and other reading.  That way, it kept these tales with their repeating themes and images fresh and enjoyable.  This book is a truly terrific resource.  It was a pleasure to read, and I am confident that I will be referring back to its pages for years to come.","Into the woods, then out of the woods... and happy ever after!",Science Fiction & Fantasy,Visit Amazon's Philip Pullman Page,Fairy Tales from the Brothers Grimm: A New English Version (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition),146800.0,hardcover,5.0

I wasn't expecting much but I was definitely surprised when this exceeded all of expectations.As usual, ya'll know how I am, I want to talk about the cover.  I guess I am a visual kind of person because a great cover can make or break a book for me.  Sometimes.This cover looks like it was drawn with a charcoal pencil by someone doing a silhouette of our main protagonist, Ember.  The girl in the cover looks withdrawn and lonely, but more importantly, hopeless.  I think this is one of those covers that shows us more of the book in the simplicity of it all.Okay, I am done raving about the cover.The story is pretty darn amazing too!  Don't get me wrong it is a dark story that starts out with Ember swallowing a bunch of pills hoping to just go to sleep but instead waking up in a hospital psych ward.  But she is so far from being your typical depressed teenager.  Ember is much stronger than she looks or gives herself credit for.At first when I was reading it,  I thought this story was going to be about Ember facing her inner demons in a more metaphorical sense but Garner really throws in the action and fantasy almost like it feels like you are there with Ember experiencing the terrifying creatures that come to visit.Garner writes an engaging character in Ember who grows as she realizes who and what she really is.  I would have to add Ember to a list of female characters that I find pretty incredible!There is a love interest in this story but it doesn't overtake the plot at all.  In fact, it ties into it more than anything like it was predestined more to me.  But that is just my opinion.Taren is a pretty cool guy but he seems to be more cliche with the whole gorgeous tortured soul type that is typical in the YA novels.Kat is  a  refreshing character in this story as well.  At first I thought she was going to be the snobby girl that only thinks of herself and resents the main character but she wasn't at all.  Yes she is gorgeous but didn't take away from the story.  In fact she creates more diversity that could help this series become even greater.I was completely enthralled in this story that I had a very hard time putting it down.  It does have similarities to The Mortal Instruments but not annoyingly so.  I also couldn't help thinking of Sam from Supernatural a little too.I really fell in love with this story and I can't wait till I get my hands on the other two books in the series!Had to give it five hearts!",Read to my Heart's Content Reviews,Teen & Young Adult,Visit Amazon's Christina Garner Page, Gateway (The Gateway Trilogy Book 1) eBook,425.0,kindle,4.25

Although it's full-length novel, it seemed short, as if the plot was too small. I enjoyed the world-building, and I really liked Ember, but I wished for more from this first installment in the Gateway Trilogy.I'm particular about Young Adult books, as I've mentioned before. I decided to read this one because I liked the premise--demons and chaos. What's not to love? There's plenty of that in the book, although I wished for more revelation of the world behind the world. I'm guessing more will be uncovered as the series progresses.One of the things I loved about the book was the main character, Ember. I'm particularly picky when it comes to my YA protagonists. I've never been one for teenaged drama, even when I was a teenager, so now that I'm adult, I'm fully out of that phase. (Pregnancy hormones not-withstanding--we'll just not go there, since my condition is temporary.) But Ember never comes across as angsty or whiny. She's always forging onward, looking to the next crisis, and generally being a badass. Even cynical old me found the romance interesting, with little to no time spent mooning over the color of Taren's eyes or where the relationship was going. A+ on the character development.I've pondered what it is about the plot that makes me feel like it wasn't enough, but I can't put my finger on one thing exactly. The ending seemed satisfying, although some of the prose got a little purple and over-dramatic for my taste. It just feels like there's not enough development of the middle. Ember gets swept away into a new world after she's committed to a mental institution, and then BAM! Time to fight the boss at the end.If you like urban fantasy young adult books, you'll enjoy this. The characters are interesting, and the world seems fully fleshed out. Hopefully more will be revealed in later books, and Ember continues to be a rock-steady teen protagonist.Also posted on my blog, Magic & Mayhem Book Reviews at saboviec.wordpress.com.","Strong protagonist, but the story lacked something.",Teen & Young Adult,Visit Amazon's Christina Garner Page, Gateway (The Gateway Trilogy Book 1) eBook,425.0,kindle,4.25

Plus the second book isn't even up on goodreads, just this one and the original look for this book. I came across this book back in December when I was trying to spend my giftcard on Kobo, so I went looking for books. Seeing this and thinking ""Wow...a book with a fox bite"" I had to read it. Now I read it and I'm so glad that I did. It was so great, I loved everything about this book and the only issues I had are really minor.The characters are so well placed in the book, Sophie at first is really shy and liked to keep to herself. She only wants to focus on her study's more then anything else. That's why her friend Beth is there to help her come out to clubs to party even when she doesn't want to. She soon loosens up when she meets Sebastian changing her in a lot of ways. He opens a life she never knew about full of love and heartbreak. Beth her best friend is a selfish person who doesn't have feelings at all and only cares about herself. . . No really that's what I think of Beth. She annoys me with saying me things to Sophie not really caring about her feelings but Sophie doesn't see this, she only see's a friend. Sebastian is a hot sexy boy with blond hair and turns into a werewolf on a fullmoon without control. Even though the werewolf he turns into is something I really don't like (meaning the more human the animal version of a werewolf) I still like the fact that they transform either way. He is a smooth talker and loves Sophie but he also loves his job so that comes into conflict a lot with the two of them. He's fun to be around and knows how to talk to girls, Sophie is his first real girlfriend so he's learning how the whole girlfriend/boyfriend thing works.  Towards the ending of the book though I find that he really doesn't care much about Sophie, which is so annoying because Sophie, even though she tells him he doesn't listen. Then there is Connor, oh he's such a cutie boy, though he doesn't know how to talk to Sophie you can see that he likes her and even tries to put the moves on her a few times. He is Sebastian's cousin and also a werewolf, where Sebastian lacks in caring for Sophie Connor is there to pick up the slack. He cares so much about her and wouldn't let anything happen to her even when Sebastian is gone or is there for that matter.The romance is so fast but Sophie at first tries to make it go slow which helps. Between Sebastian and her you see the chemistry between them and they can't help themselves but to make that chemistry go somewhere. So Sebastian kept being persistent and finally they're together. You can see how much Sophie loves Sebastian even though time and time again he hurts her. Later you see that her and Connor almost having the same kind of Chemistry. I do hope in the second book something happens between Sophie and Connor.As for the plot, it was great, it was new and exciting. With the use of werewolves, vampires and demons the whole story worked out right. Not to mention that the werewolves are the olden type of werewolves, not the new type. The plot is mainly focused on Sophie and her view of what's happening around her. It takes place at university in England (didn't know this till a bit later on). She moved closer to the university to be with her friend Beth where they both stayed in the same apartment. It doesn't take long before Sophie, meets Sebastian and there relationship kicks off. With Connor also wanting to be with her and bad guys who want her around every corner this whole story is great from start to finish.",Wow new and inventive!,Teen & Young Adult,Visit Amazon's Raquel Lyon Page, A Brush with the Moon (Foxblood Trilogy One) (Fosswell Chronicles Book 1) eBook,3578.0,kindle,4.25

There are shifters, vamps, demons, inter-dimensional travel, a rotating love triangle, and the real life of a university student complete with trials, tribulations, and parties. Yes, this book is about werewolves and vampires, but that is where the similarity to most other books of the genre ends. Lyon takes this basic premise and runs far and fast with it, giving her audience a novel that cannot be put down.Lyon manages to work in little bits of background information throughout the story, giving her readers the pertinent information when necessary. This means that there is no long, drawn out lull where all background information is given. This is masterfully done. She also uses vivid descriptions and backgrounds to set up her story without being long winded or confusing. Even the town names are fittingly symbolic.And let's not forget the cast of characters that we meet in this novel. They are very well developed and suit their lives perfectly. Their interactions with each other are uniquely realistic as well. One moment you are seeing the cattiness of social cliques colliding, followed the next by true friendships, and then again by budding romantic relationships. They are the type of people that you would want to live with in real life.When pulled all together Lyon`s novel is written in a way that YA and adult readers alike can enjoy. She never once talks down to her audience, nor does she assume that we, as readers, will piece together backgrounds that are not provided.

This had a lot going for it, and in the beginning I liked it a lot - promising characters in Sophie and her friends, some nice gothic mystery trappings - but as it went on it was rather disappointing. There is a lot of complex, original supernatural mythology, but it didn't have nearly enough world-building. It was all crammed into one book at a weird kind of fast pace - it almost felt like watching a movie on Fast-Forward! Also, I could never get a real handle on who Sophie was as a person. Her characterization was kind of inconsistent, which was fine for other characters whose motivations remain mysterious to help drive the plot, but mostly just confusing in the lead POV. I also had issue with the grammar throughout - mostly with commas, or lack thereof. In short, there were some nice ideas here, but it felt more like a first draft than a polished novel.","nice ideas, but seems like a first draft",Teen & Young Adult,Visit Amazon's Raquel Lyon Page, A Brush with the Moon (Foxblood Trilogy One) (Fosswell Chronicles Book 1) eBook,3578.0,kindle,4.25

This was a fabulous novel that sucked me in and made it impossible for me to set down until I'd read every word.  Kirkpatrick is a phenomenal writer and she blew me away with her debut novel Into the Shadows!  I was on pins and needles throughout most of the book, worried about Paivi and her family--the similarities between this novel and the Red Scare were chilling.  Part of the reason I love this novel so much is because it has aspects of our history intermingled within it.  As it's a YA novel, it helps remind young people about the atrocities our own country, and many others, have committed when scared--such as stripping people of their human rights, arresting them without providence, ruining careers/lives due to paranoia, and forcing people to wear badges identifying themselves as enemies of the state.  This is a very real offence that has happened in many countries, and Kirkpatrick does a phenomenal job showing the reader the errors of our past through this fictitious novel, while also making it very clear that human panic and the mob mentality can easily overtake a nation; it could easily happen again if we aren't careful.What happens to Paivi and her family is atrocious, but so captivating that you will not be able to put the novel down.  Instead of looking at communism or ethnicity, this novel looks at the war on terror, rounding up those believed to be aiding terrorists and blacklisting them as the country runs scared--stripping them of all their human rights, though no evidence if available to convict.  But, in actuality, it seems those blacklisted by fictional Senator Stevens have been declared enemies of the state solely because they have special abilities, such as being able to see the future, like Paivi and her parents, or being able to read minds, like Christian.This novel drudged up many feelings for me, in terms of the atrocities of the Holocaust, which started off with Jews being forced to wear badges (like Paivi, her family, and everyone else blacklisted as enemies of the state).  This made me nervous, and angry, as I read, especially since we all know that the Holocaust rapidly became much worse than only having to wear badges.  As the story progresses, Into the Shadows begins to show how much worse it can get, and though it does end abruptly, leaving the reader antsy for more, I can only imagine that the sequel, hopefully releasing late this summer, will go further into its scary similarities of the Holocaust and the Red Scare.  It can only get much, much worse for Paivi and her family before it begins to get better.  I LOVE this story, and cannot wait for the sequel.  I highly suggest picking up this novel!

After the first 2 chapters, I honestly wanted to give up on the story all together.

And ""Happy birthday, your family is special, we all have special powers, but you can't do anything about it.""  It all just seemed ridiculous.  But, I am the type who has to finish a book, I can't leave even the silliest of books unread.  The plot had potential, but the characters had little substance.

If we forget past history like the rise of Nazism in Germany then we are doomed to repeat it.  Our founders understood that too much centralized power in government is dangerous and lends itself to the rise of dictatorships. I liked the story for that reason.  On the other hand what I found disturbing was the authors assumption that terrorism would come from the right wing.  Than kind of bothered me.  I have seen too much malicious political bias coming from the left.  To me, terrorism would more likely come from the extreme left. I see the USA currently controlled by a corrupt left that believes that the end justifies the means.  A philosophy that ignores established constitutional law and does what it wants with impunity.

As Jack is lying there dying he tells his vampire friends to leave him at the door step of his brother s house so he can die in his family home. Only when he wakes up he realizes he is not in his family home but he is in that girl from the cemeteries house. In shock he wants to know who she is and what she wants. He knows she is a hunter and could kill him at any time but he wants to know what she has planned out for him.The next morning he awakes in her bed with the sun shinning on him and he panics because the sun burns up vampires. It is then that he realizes he is no longer a vampire but a human. He and the girl talk and he finds out that he is part of a plan to save the world from vampires and werewolves. As the story unfolds Jack must make some serious decisions and he must learn to trust humans, but there is a problem because he has been a vampire for 10 years he just can't turn off his vampire ways and so trusting humans is a no no so he must fight that in order to survive.Things start to go bump in the night and Jack must chose between good and evi. He must decide if he can kill as a human or be killed. He also has learned that the one person he trusts and loves the most is the one that will kill him. What a boy to do?Memorable Quotes: Page 143 Jack and Silver Talking to each other: Jack crossed the room to the book shelf and picked up the volume Jersey had wanted him to read. It was one of his favorites, one of Lily's favorites. Jack opened it. Jersey had written a little note on the inside. We all have a destiny, known or unknown.Our choice is to run from it or embrace it. Choose well.""You really liked him, didn't you?"" Silver's expression was one of total disbelief.""After everything he did, you still like him."" How could he explain it to her? ""He reminded me of my father. Not in a bad way. My father kept his emotions in check. He gave new meaning to calm, cool, and collected. Then there was the way I felt when talking to Jersey. He had all this wisdom to impart, and he did it eagerly. Having him around was almost like having my father back."" Silver walked over to him and slid into his arms. The side of her face pressed against his chest. She mumbled against his shirt. ""I'm sorry you had to lose him. My parents are searching for Jersey via computer and contacts, but they probably won't be able to find him for a long time. Maybe by the time they do, I'll be able to suck his soul out, and you won't have to kill him."" It was a horrible thing to wish for, but Jack found himself doing just that. He wasn't sure if he had the strength to face Jersey on a battlefield. No matter what awful things Jersey had done, Jack feared he would always love the man. At least the parts that reminded him of the father he'd lost. Would it be better for Jersey to have his soul sucked out or to be touched by the rock? ""What do you think happens to the souls you suck out? Are they lost forever?"" ""No. Didn't you read that part in the diary?"" ""I guess I missed it."" ""Lovely says they travel on, heaven or hell, wherever they were meant to be."" That didn't sound so bad. ""I'll be back in a second."" Jack sprinted out to the car and retrieved the diary. Since it was still in his possession, he wanted to read the part about sucking souls out again. Silver had read it enough to know what page the information could be found on. He leaned in through the open window, took the diary out of the glove compartment. As he pulled it through the window, it slipped from his fingers. The diary opened on the ground to a brand new page. Jack hunched over it and read it again and again. He swallowed hard. Disbelief hardened his heart. No way. Someone was messing with him. He grabbed the diary, slapped it shut, but it was too late. The words were burned inside his brain. Beware of Silver, Jack. Betrayal will lead to your death. It had to be a trick. Somehow Jersey had planted the page, forged Lovely's handwriting. Jack didn't believe for a second that Silver would betray him. She most certainly would not lead him to his death. The sucking-out-souls passage forgotten, he tossed the diary back through the open window. With slow feet and a sinking spirit, he returned to the secret mansion beneath the house. He didn't say a word to Silver about the new prophecy.Advice: This is a must read!

Deeth ""Sheila Deeth""",4.0,2012,"Jack would love nothing more than to be human again, but Jack died ten years ago and now his little brother's older than him and his girlfriends are fighting over him. A teen novel with vampires who aren't adorably dreamy and dangers that really might include death and dismemberment, K.C. Blake's Vampires Rule makes a refreshing change.Jack gets his wish, but living a normal high-school life in the daylight doesn't quite live up to expectations. As he worries about whether he's really ""safe"" he finds he has no-one to talk to, except a teacher who seems to know entirely too much.There's a halting romance between Jack and Silver, romantic tension between Jack and his vampire friend, sibling rivalry between Jack and his brother, and an intriguing mentor-mentee relationship building between Jack and the man who might be his nemesis. Different weights are given to different relationships throughout the tale, and book two, Werewolves Rule might resolve some of the mysteries left open at the end. But Vampires Rule comes to a satisfying conclusion, avoiding both simple endings and out-and-out conflict, leaving a curious sense of mystery with ancient prophesy and modern hope.Written with a nicely youthful point of view, instilling just enough confidence to make me believe all the coincidences will be explained, this novel reads well on its own and is a worthy beginning to a series.Disclosure: I was lucky enough to get a free ecopy and promised myself I'd write a review in thanks.",Intriguingly different vampire and werewolf series,Teen & Young Adult,Visit Amazon's Kasi Blake Page, Vampires Rule (Rule Series Book 1) eBook,10618.0,kindle,4.0

Hehe... The concept of human evolution and the ability to use more than only 1/8 of the brain was pretty cool, too! Kind of making them like super heroes, but in a totally different context.As a main character, Jade wasn't half bad. She was tenacious and curious, not afraid to stand up for herself. But sometimes she annoyed me with how much she cried. Granted, the things she experienced would've had me bawling my eyes out, so I can't judge.And Aiden....OMG!!! Ahhhhh *squeal* I am in love with that boy! Seriously, he just sounds like such a sweetheart with a rockin' set of abs and everything. Plus he can read minds and do all kinds of cool stuff! His character was enjoyable to follow, since his emotions usually center on his feelings for Jade. His protectiveness, his sense of humor...all of it plays off of Jade in a way that makes them a cute couple.The only problem I had was the issue of how Jade and Chelsea reacted to the things that happened to them. There was a bit of discontinuity there. Like one minute Jade would be bawling, then the next she'd be totally okay. A little weird...Loved the mystery of the book, too.

Maybe in an ideal world, people would have continued to heeded this small stricture of the God of Magic, who provided the elements initially. But any society is hardly ever ideal-and when people forget, or turn to science, or embrace the concept that such rules are simply legend and myth-then people forget, and intermarry, and elements mix. So offspring were born who possessed an element, but only weakly; and sometimes there simply was no element at all in a particular individual. So Magic itself began to decline, weakening and diluting. Sometimes, those without an element found they could acquire one-if only temporarily-by murder. As we all know, murder rarely satisfies a killer for very long-and elements acquired by murder don't remain-so those under the control of ""magic disease,"" discovered to be contagious through intimate transmission, are almost always feared and dreaded-even to the point of becoming murder victims themselves.At the University of Magic, our heroine Ria, who possesses Element of Fire, and her best friend Paula, of the Element of Air and a scientific research-oriented mind) are first-year students, with the goal of learning to use their elements. Paula wants also to find the cure for ""magic disease"" and eventually eradicate it. All four elements (fire, air, water, earth) attend the University, so naturally the odds are they will encounter individuals who hold other elements, and even feel drawn to some of them. A ""magic disease"" carrier, Adrian, is also a University of Magic student, perhaps because he had been orphaned and society really knows nowhere else to place him.Going by the settings, the characterizations, and the issues, I believe this novel would appeal to readers who enjoy YA Paranormal, and perhaps YA Fantasy.",Elemental Magick in YA Paranormal/Fantasy,Teen & Young Adult,Visit Amazon's Alycia Linwood Page, Dangerous (Element Preservers Book 1) eBook,11116.0,kindle,3.0

In the previous volume, Will and his friends helped the Skandians to defend against the Temujai invaders.  When they arrived back in Araluen, King Duncan was very pleased for the return of his daughter.  Horace was knighted, Halt was officially reinstated, and Will gained the surname of Treaty.In this novel, Will Treaty is now a full-fledged Ranger with a bit a fame for his accomplishments.  He is assigned to a fief in Southeastern Araluen.  On the way there, he acquires an abused dog with a large cut in her side.Erak is now the Oberjarl of Skandia and Will's friend.  He had brought Will and Evanlyn to Skandia as slaves, but helped them to escape.  Then they had all fought together against the Temujai.Halt is a full Ranger, dangerous and feared.  He had been Will's mentor before Will was promoted.Alyss is also a former ward of the barony like Will.  Now she is a Diplomatic Courier, working for Lady Pauline.In this story, Will arrives in Seacliff Fief with Tug and the dog.  As he rides through the village, he notices a green-eyed young woman watching him.  He reaches the Ranger's quarters and takes the young border shepherd into the cabin.While Will settles the dog near the hearth, he notices the neatness of the cabin  and the lit fire.  Then he meets the housekeeper -- Edwina -- and willingly accepts her services. Later, the green-eyed girl -- Edwina's daughter Delia -- brings him a very savory stew for his supper.Will soon meets Baron Ergell and the Battlemaster, Sir Norris of Rook.  Both the Baron and the Battlemaster seem to be friendly, but Will has to avoid a few political traps.  Over the next few weeks, however, Will finds the household troops of the barony to lack training and practice.  He is going to have to report their deficiencies in his next report.Then the wolfship arrives.  Will knows that the local forces would not be sufficient to turn back the raiders, so he devises an alternative.  He goes to meet the skirl leading the Skandians.  Of course, it helps considerably that he is a friend of Erak.This tale takes Will and Alyss north to the border with the Scotti.  The lord of Macindaw fortress has become ill and rumor says that the illness was caused by sorcery.  Halt tells Will that almost every case attributed to sorcery can be explained by other causes, but at least one percent might be true sorcery.This novel leaves many unresolved problems.

The tenth book in this series, The Emperor of Nihan-Ja, released in April of 2011.  This book was a solid addition to the series and an enjoyable read.  It is another of those books in this series that is only the first half of a story arc.Will is taking up his own post at a castle in the Northern territories.  As he settles in to his new position he receives a message from his old friend Alyss, all is not well in the North and Will needs to go and check it out.  Masquerading as a jongleur, Will investigates stories of bad sorcery and mysterious illness.It was a lot of fun to Will striking out on his own as a Ranger.  I was a bit disappointed that he stays in his new territory such a short time and then is sent north to a different area.  It was interesting to watch Will work at playing a completely different role (that of a traveling musician) when he's just finally out on his own as a Ranger.There were some great new characters added to the mix.  Will ends up with a faithful dog companion that added a lot to the story.  A strange ""black"" magician also looks to add a lot to the story.  I was a bit disappointed we didn't see much of Halt in this book, but Alyss is present for much of the story and she is a wonderful humorous character that really is fun to read about.The story is well-written, as with previous books there is nothing especially creative or intriguing about the world here.  It is a pretty straight-forward adventure fantasy.  I love the humor that is woven throughout, it mimics real life well and keeps things from getting too serious.This book does something that has happened in previous books, it only tells half of a story.  The story ends pretty much with everything up in the air.  So, if you hate being left hanging I would definitely pick up the sixth book, The Seige of Macindaw, right away so that you can read it when you are done with this one.Overall a great addition to the series.  This is the start of a new story arc and there are some fun characters added.  Will and Alyss spend a lot of time together in this story and it was great to have Alyss featuring in the story.  Halt is scarce, though and I missed him.  I was upset at how the book was ended right in the middle of the story again, but that just makes me want to read book six, The Seige of Macindaw, more.

He is on a special assignment, disguised as a jongleur (wandering entertainer) whose mission is to discover what is going on in the strategically important Norgate Fife. The King is ill and cannot be healed, and there are rumors that an ancient sorcerer has somehow come back to life and is living in the forest by the northernmost fortress of Norgate.Will is mostly on his on in this book. Horace has only a minuscule role, and Halt and Crowley probably have fewer than five pages total devoted to them. Instead, in this fifth book, Will shares the stage with Courier Alyss, one of the orphans he grew up with. Will, however, is definitely the main star.There's plenty of Ranger action, adventure, and intrigue, plus Tug and the presence of a new friend, a deeply loyal and intelligent dog who (so far) doesn't have a name.The book ends with the mystery of the sorcerer solved, but everything else (the safety of the fife, the health of the king, a potential invasion of the northern neighbors, Alyss's safety, and what role Horace will play in the story) is primed for the next book. I'm grateful that I don't have to wait a year for it to be published! It's already on my bookshelf.A word of warning: as the characters have grown up, so has the language.

It's quirky, it's extraordinary, it's insane, but never once did I drop my suspension of disbelief.  Jubilee is smart and funny and reminds me a little of myself.  I thought her relationship with her boyfriend, Noah, was complicated and interesting as well.  Noah was a great boyfriend to Jubilee when she didn't need him to be emotionally engaged.  When she did, he didn't know how to react, being so self-centered and so focused on his aspirations.  It was clever, it was different, and yet it was realistic and believable.  Stuart was a sweetheart, and his family was so charming and quirky.  The story was quick, outrageous, and yet somehow believable--and most importantly funny!  I was reading this while flying to Denver, and at one point, I was shaking with barely contained laughter.John Green's story, A Cheertastic Christmas was enjoyable as well.  The scenarios were crazy and funny, the character growth very organic, and the ending was perfect (yeah, a little rushed, but it was almost told in that teenager way of hurrying).  But I'll admit, I wasn't too keen on the whole ""tough girl falls for best friend"" act.  Also, and more importantly, the characters in this story were the EXACT SAME as in the other Green novel I read (the ONLY other Green novel I've read), Paper Towns.  Tobin was Quentin; JP was Ben to a ""T""; the Duke was oddly reminiscent of Margot (although there were obvious BIG differences, to those who've read Paper Towns).  Even the story was eerily familiar of the big cross country drive that Quentin and friends took in Paper Towns.  It was like this was the further adventures of Quentin without the main character being Quentin.  Don't get me wrong, Green writes his characters well, but when I open a new story, I expect to see slightly different characters, not the same ones over and over and over again.  Same with story.""The Patron Saint of Pigs"" by Lauren Myracle was a complete downer for me.  Most of the action takes place after Christmas (bye, bye Christmas charm and spirit!), Addie is so mopey, whiney, and ungrateful in the beginning (not a good way to endear an audience to your protagonist), and the situations, while nowhere near as weird as what Johnson and Green wrote, seem contrived.  The pipes break at the exact time Addie is rinsing out the steamer?  Her boss gets mad at her...because Addie can't shut off the water because the pipes are broken and it's not really her fault anyway as she didn't break the pipes herself?  Everyone and his mother decide simultaneously to let Addie know how selfish she is?  Nathan is upset at her because she never ""read the note"" and calls her selfish...but he's been harping on this for four years?  How does that not make him whacked out?  Sure, Addie's a selfish @#$%^, but he certainly doesn't have to gripe about the ""wrongs"" she ""done him"" four years ago.  And when Addie calls Dorrie about her recent crisis, Dorrie gets upset because Addie still hasn't gotten the pig.  Only, Addie has been at WORK the entire time unable to go on break, and that's why she hasn't been able to get the pig.  Yeah, it's selfish to want to chat before getting the pig, but really, Addie TRIED to leave work to pick up the pig, and her boss wouldn't let her.  So that isn't Addie's fault, it's her bosses fault, and it's Dorrie who's being the @ss for blaming the wrong person.  And the whole shoehorning ""It's a Wonderful Life"" needed to go.Overall, though, I really liked ""Let It Snow"".  Johnson's and Green's stories and characters are wonderful, funny, and charming (not to mention, very Christmas-y!).  Individually, I would rate them 5 and 3.5 - 4 stars respectively and would definitely read them over and over again.  As for Myracle's story, unless you are already a fan of her work, I wouldn't bother with her story (even though it does tie up Jeb's loose end).  It's kinda depressing, not really Christmas-y, and bonkers.  Two stars, by itself.So head off to the bookstore or library, snatch this guy up and snuggle with a cup of hot chocolate under a blanket in front of your fire or Christmas tree and start reading!Brought to you by:*C.S.

Whilst it was a light, easy-going read, I felt it was too shallow, abrupt, and not very well thought-out. Obviously, the authors have to contend with certain limits as this is an anthology of short stories, but I feel like it could've used more depth.Usually, when reading a John Green novel, I don't feel like I'm reading a Young Adult novel, as his stories are very mature and profound. And I'm usually a huge fan of his secondary characters. His story ""A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle"" didn't do it for me however. I found his characters annoying, childish and extremely immature. I found the whole basis of the plot shallow and superficial. And I also found the way the main characters suddenly revealed their feelings at the end to be somewhat fake and contrived. It was, I would say, my least favourite of all three. Therefore, it gets one star.My second least favourite would be Lauren Myracle's ""The Patron Saint of Pigs"". Although there was an entire introduction to Jeb in both the first stories, he only showed up in the last chapter of his actual story. Furthermore, Myracle's story was the longest of the three, taking sixteen chapters, and fifteen of those sixteen chapters were devoted to main character Addie. Who suffice it to say was the most annoying, overbearing, self-absorbed character I've seen. Dedicating fifteen chapters to only her does not help tone down that image. She was very irritating to read about, and the storyline lacked so much depth and subplots. The only thing I liked about the story, and the only reason it puts it in second place for me, is the last chapter where ALL the characters from ALL three stories clash and meet at Starbucks. That was pretty cool, and very interesting and funny to read. Otherwise, the first fifteen chapters did not do it for me at all. For that, this story also gets only one star.The first story by Maureen Johnson, ""The Jubilee Express"", was perhaps the best out of the bunch. For starters, I could actually see it made into a full-blown novel, the main characters and secondary characters were all introduced very well, they all had their own storylines, and it was all laid out perfectly for us - the readers - to know what to expect in following stories. I also liked how she introduced Jeb before Stuart, making me think Jeb was the main character, only to introduce Stuart several chapters later. Also, Stuart's mom and sister's roles were hilarious, and were created very nicely to go with the story and with Jubilee's weird family. All in all, it was a great story out of all three. It had a solid introduction, body, and conclusion. Plus, I really liked Stuart's character the most. Jubilee was annoying at one point, and the whole falling in love in a matter of one day makes me question the credibility of the book, but hey, it's a Christmas anthology, and for that, I'm letting it pass! And because I liked this story more than the other two, I'm giving it two stars.All in all, you get a four star book, although in reality and as a whole, it should be worth three stars in my book.",Not a fan,Teen & Young Adult,Visit Amazon's John Green Page,Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances,12493.0,hardcover,4.5

Could you really expect less from 3 amazing authors, though? First, I'll break it down into the tree stories.The Jubilee Express by Maureen JohnsonTake hilarious shenanigans, Christmas, and romance; mix them thoroughly and what do you end up with? Magic, I tell you, magic. I can't even count how many times I laughed out loud while reading this. I could read a whole book about Jubilee because she's unintentionally hilarious. Plus, she's the type of girl who'll trudge through 5 feet of snow by herself to go to a Waffle House and that's the type of girl I like to read about.Her relationship with Stuart is good even though they had a lot of unnecessary miscommunication at the end. They start out as strangers (Stuart seeming a little more strange upon first glance) in a Waffle House then progress to friendly jabs at each other, and finally they realize that being together is kind of nice. Basically what I'm saying is that it all felt really natural except, you know, for the fact that the first night they met she slept on his couch...A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle by John GreenMr. Green presents a familiar situation: guy friend and girl friend both like each other but neither realizes. Part of me was always going ""Tobin, you idiot! Can you not see the googly eyes Duke is making and the massive elphant-sized hints she's dropping?!"" But no, because I've totally been there. Before my (now) husband and I started dating I'm pretty sure everyone in the entire town knew we liked each other but could we see it? Hah, not a chance. So Tobin and Duke's relationship was predictable, but that didn't diminish its cuteness.I liked that even though there were three (well, technically four, but he was mostly just on the phone) friends the third didn't just become a third wheel left out in the cold. JP (said third friend) was hilarious and had a great relationship with both Duke and Tobin and the story certainly wouldn't be the same without him.The Patron Saint of Pigs by Lauren MyracleMyracle's story wasn't the laugh-out-loud hilarious type like the other two, but it kind of ended up balancing everything out. Now, it's pretty obvious within the first couple pages that this will be a coming-to-terms-with-the-fact-that-you-need-to-change type of story, but again, predictability isn't always a bad thing.I didn't really understand Addie. All the people closest to her are telling her she's self-absorbed and she refuses to listen and just rattles off all the problems with her life instead. Plus, why in the world would you break up with someone if YOU are the cheater and your other half DOESN'T want to break up? I just don't get it. That's kind of the point of Addie, though. She's dramatic and just does things but you get to see her grow into a better person by the end.One of the best things about this little trio of stories is the way you get to watch them all come together. At first it's just a few references to people or happenings you heard about before, but then it all builds up into this giant avalanche of crossing paths and you see how everyone affected everyone else. It's pretty neat and (for the most part) believable too.The Nutshell: If you want a cute, funny winter read by some awesome authors then you simply must pick up Let It SnowDirect Hit",Cute winter read,Teen & Young Adult,Visit Amazon's John Green Page,Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances,12493.0,hardcover,4.5

As soon as I finished I ran to Target to buy the next in the series that night, and finished that the next day too. The tv series and the book series are very different, but both are equally as interesting. You fall in love with the characters so quickly.

In the show, the background story is interesting, the characters are gorgeous, the plot line is very active and intriguing, and I was left with only wanting more. So, I picked up the books which I had saved on my shelf since finishing Twilight. And did it live up to the show...Not so much. :(High Notes: While waiting until I had the time to watch season 2 of The Vampire Diaries online, I turned to the books to get just a little bit more of Elena, Stefan, and the oh-so-irresistible Damon. I figured that the books would just fill me in on more of the deliciousness that the show wasn't able to fit in. Let me just say that I was in for a surprise. From the first page, I thought, ""This is...wrong!"" I know this is supposed to be the high note section, but I can't think of ANYTHING that I really LOVED!!!I did like that the plot in the book moved fast like the show, but at least the show slowed down the romance. In the show, Elena and Stefan had time to get to know each other, their obvious attraction towards each other, and eventual love and modesty. In the book, it goes from Elena ""having to have"" Stefan when Stefan ignored her to instantaneous soul mates when Stefan saved her one night.I also enjoyed Damon (my absolute favorite on the show), but it took him forever to show up and without Ian Somerholder's beautiful eyes staring at you when Damon speaks, it's just NOT the same.Low Notes: I have got A LOT to say here!!! But, I will try and keep it short and not let it turn into a rant. (That's going to be hard, though.)First off, the book's plot relies HEAVILY on coincidences. (I feel that one coincidence in a book is acceptable. Anymore is CHEAP!) For example, in the show, Stefan seeks out Elena when he discovers that she looks very much like his 150 year-old, ex-girlfriend, Katherine, that he thinks died during sometime around the Civil War. However, in the book, Stefan just happens to move from Italy to this itty-bitty town of Fell's Church, and just happens to decide to go to this high school so he can integrate with the humans, and this just happens to see a girl that looks a lot like his dead undead ex-girlfriend that he had around the Renaissance period. That's THREE coincidences in ONE chapter!!! And they just keep coming. It really destroys the believability of the book.Secondly, the instantaneous romance that I mentioned before.Thirdly, Elena is a shallow, snobbish, and kind of a b*tch in the book! And Katherine looks like a pretty, frail, nave child. Making you not even like the main character! This is opposed to the show which makes Elena strong, empathetic, self-sacrificing, and lovable while Katherine is her doppelganger, a sexy, manipulative, brat. This just clearly defines Elena as the protagonist and Katherine as her personal antagonist. The other characters get more background story and bit more of the limelight in the show as well.Finally, there is a whole lot of sucking of each other's blood in the book. Yes, that's what vampire's do, but the books glorify it as the only way Elena and Stephan can connect and feel close to each other. I didn't like it.Ratings:Character Development: 2/5Dialogue: 3/5Prose: 2/5Believability: 1/5Style and Grammar: 1.5/5Overall Rating: 37% Suckage!This is my personal recommendation...Please read carefully!SAVE YOURSELF FROM THE BOOK!

I recently finished reading the first two books of the series (as included in this compilation) and I have to say - I thought the books were pretty great!I have had a difficult time becoming interested in vampire books after reading the Twilight series. I like the first book, didn't so much like the second one, liked the third and was torn between like and annoyance on the fourth. But all in all, reading the Twilight series put me off vampires for a good, long while.Picking up The Vampire Diaries, however, I found myself quickly reading through these two books - and finding myself completely interested in vampires and their world again. L.J. Smith does a great job bringing vampires into the real world (so to speak) and I commend her for reigniting my interest in these supernatural beings.The Awakening (Book 1) is a prettily written story that introduces us to Mystic Falls, a small, seemingly unremarkable town that is filled with suburbs, traditions and familiarity. We meet our characters for the first time - Elena, Stefan, Damon, Bonnie, Meredith, Caroline, Matt, Tyler, to name a few, and glean some insight into who they are.The Struggle (Book 2) picks up after the cliffhanger ending from Book 1 and proceeds to show us how life has changed after a few short weeks of the Salvatore brothers being in Mystic Falls. There's a lot of stuff that does go down in this one, and it was even more of a cliffhanger for me than the first!I thought that the way the story was told was pretty good. There was a bit of tension between characters that I thought added some great depth, especially upon the revelation about vampires. The action sequences, the surprising twist of events, the suspicious and borderline creepy circumstances - all of them had me hanging on to the edge of my seat.It was easy to fall in love with each of the characters or hate them (because of their characteristics or because of things that happen, which I shall not mention so as not to spoil the story), as they were quite well-written. It's funny though - because of the books, I find that I am drawn towards pairing Stefan and Elena together more now.One other aspect of the books I like is the concept of the diary/journal. Writers, or girls who like to write, always appeal to me so this was an additional bonus.All in all, it was a nice solid beginning to a series that I'm definitely going to continue reading.","good, solid beginning",Teen & Young Adult,Visit Amazon's L.

I loved how the characters express their feelings toward music and how music affects them as a being. The characters are very well-developed and you can't help but fall in love with them all, from the trendy punk parents to the hipster teens. Mia's memories are like a family photo album full of snapshots of happy times.This book is about friendship, family, love, life and the tough decisions we are faced with in order to have these things. It is a well-written and well-formulated story which makes you think long after you've turned the last page. There were times where I laughed and some where I cried, and although it wrenches the heart, it definitely is not one to be missed.Getting some insider info on the book - I just read that Catherine Hardwicke (Twilight) will direct the movie. That's definitely something I'll be looking forward to.

Maybe the author wanted to make it 'real' by including all the harsh language, but to me it was just 'real' offensive.  I give the storyline five stars, but the choice of constant filthy language throughout the book, zero stars. I will definitely be making sure my daughters don't read this book.

I decided to read this book because for one there is a ton of hype about how amazing it is on goodreads and for two it was a book of the month for one of the book clubs I'm in. I think I expected too much from this book and that's why it only got four stars. Don't get me wrong and please do not misinterpret what I'm saying, this book is worth the read and I am very excited to read Where She Went, I definitely recommend you read it. I just feel like the way Mia was so unemotional and detached for so long in the beginning of the book wasn't realistic. To a point yes, adrenaline can cause a delay in the shock of events as traumatic as these but it seemed like it took her FOREVER to realize what had happened to her family and her. After she finally started showing some emotion to what the heck was going on this book got way good, I also loved learning more about her and Adam's relationship. The little scene where they play each other like instruments is so sweet and intimate, I loved it. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys young adult books about trauma, it does have a little bit of a love story twisted in also. It's not a huge, huge part though. I think it will be more about Adam and Mia in Where She Went! (:Favorite Quotes""But there's no one else like me around.

I've been hearing about the Queen's Thief books for ages now on the blogosphere, and they were on my list, but I wasn't prompted to actually pick them up until Chachic of Chachic's Book Nook hosted a lovely Queen's Thief Week. What I found when I did, I will love forever. It is so rare for those of us who read so many books to be really truly surprised by anything. I find I am constantly anticipating plots, and more often than not, I am correct, and even if I am not correct, I am not often surprised. This didn't happen with The Thief. Not only did I have no idea how the story was going to end until I got there, I had no idea what was coming next from any individual turn, I could no more predict or see things coming than if I had never consumed a book before in my life. Days later my head is still spinning and I am marveling--how did Megan Whalen Turner do it?!This is one of those books with immediate reread value. I already want to go back through, knowing how things turn out, to see the crumbs that I inevitably stumbled blindly over along the way. Part of me is so sad that I did not discover these books when I was younger, but part of me is so happy to just now being experiencing this story for the first time. The world created by Megan Whalen Turner is full of beautiful myths of creation and the gods, and I could not be happier about her simultaneously writing from a male perspective set in a world where females are so strong, and not degraded or regulated to certain positions. Additionally, instead of being set in a medieval world, as is so often in high fantasy, the world of The Thief came across more as that in The Three Musketeers, a transition between medieval and renaissance. And that, my friends, is awesome.I loved the characters involved, primarily because they were so well written and constructed. Honestly while reading, I didn't know how I felt about many of them, and this was great! I wasn't always sure Gen knew how he felt about the rest of the cast either, particularly the magus who is alternately despicable and generally well intentioned. Also, can I just say that my heart was captured by Gen the second I learned that he hated horses? I don't hate horses, but neither does anyone else, especially not in fantasies set in time periods where horses are the prime means of transportation. This one quality stood out so much to me, it made me smile at its uniqueness.I could go on to wax poetically for some time, but I refuse to talk about this book in any way that might ruin it for anyone who has yet to read it.

However, this book is just too awesome. To warn you, I'll probably end up going into many tangents, but I'll try to remain helpful in this review. Odds are by the time you've read this review you know what the story is about and who the characters are, so I'll skip the summary and go right into analysis.Gen's voice is distinct and entertaining from the beginning. The entire story is from the first person point of view, and the amount of narration greatly outweighs the amount of dialogue. However, even though we're pretty much in Gen's head 24/7 he manages to keep several secrets from us until the very end.Gen isn't the only one with secrets, several other characters have them as well. It is because of these secrets that my opinion of the characters changed at the end, however I'll give the impression I had of them for the beginning and middle of the story. The Magus, Pol, Sophos, and Ambiades each have a secret as well as a unique personality.My impression of Magus for the majority of the story was that he's a pompous jerk. However Turner does a good job of changing my mind in the end (not an easy thing to do). My opinion of Pol was somewhat split. On one hand he does a lot of the Magus' bidding which makes him seem mean, on the other hand he is civil and respectful of Gen - not from the start, but around the middle he becomes respectful.Sophos is really sweet. He's nice and kind, especially to Gen, but unfortunately lets other people control him. Ambiades...don't get me started on him. I don't like him. Nope. Not at all. Didn't from the beginning. If I viewed the Magus as a pompous jerk, it makes sense Ambiades is his apprentice as he's a mini version of the pompous jerk. A pompous jerk in training you might say.The plot itself had many twists and turns, ups and downs. Few things I was able to predict, but most I wasn't. The pacing, was admittedly slow in some places, to the point where I skipped some parts and went back to read them later on. The world building was amazingly extensive. Turner really did her research in every little detail.My one true complaint is the fact that we never really learn what the ages of the characters are. It's implied Gen, Sophos, and Ambiades are in their late teens or early twenties. Magus and Pol somewhere past 35, probably younger than 60.Over all the book is an enticing and enjoyable read.

Slagar, the Sly One, is a Fox with a grudge against Redwall for previous disastrous encounters with the current warrior, Matthias. The disfigured fox concocts a diabolical scheme to kidnap the Abbey youngsters to enslave them in the underground realm of Malkariss, far to the dreaded South.Can young Mattimeo, a rebelious scamp, live up to his up to the legacy of his ancestors and ultimately make his father proud?  Will the current warrior mouse, Matthias, lead a successful quest of search and rescue--or die in the attempt?

Barron gives his densely, mythologically fantastical take on Merlin in ""The Lost Years,"" a colorful and lushly-detailed novel about the teenage wizard's formative years. The ""Star Wars"" twist is rather predictable, but otherwise it's a delightful story.Years ago, the boy Emrys was washed up on the shores of Wales, along with an equally mysterious woman named Branwen. He can't remember her, or anything else from his prior life.And for some years, he and Branwen live in a small Welsh village, where they are reviled because of their strangeness. When some village boys attack Branwen, Emrys' magical powers are unleashed -- and he ends up blind, but able to use his ""second sight."" Since Branwen refuses to tell him anything about his past, Emrys sets off on his own quest.He ends up on the shores of the magical land of Fincayra, where he meets the quirky woodland girl Rhia. Unfortunately, Fincayra is slowly being withered by a magical blight. With the help of Rhia and a diminuative giant named Shim, Merlin must find use his heart, brain, powers, and the mysterious Galator pendant to defeat the evil Rhita Gawr, find the Seven Treasures, and save Fincayra.T.A. Barron obviously loves two things -- myth'n'legends, and nature. ""The Lost Years"" is soaked in both these things. He writes in a lush, intoxicatingly detailed prose, with the overhanging presence of living trees, cool leaves and wild magical places. It's a bit like wandering into an enchanted grove, and watching the epic story unfold outside.Like his prior novel ""The Merlin Effect,"" Barron laces it softly with Celtic mythology and Arthurian legend (such as the magic cauldron and the god Dagda), as well as some interesting ideas of his own (""historical"" versus ""sacred"" time). The only problem is that Barron pulls a ""Star Wars"" twist out of his hat late in the novel, which is one of the few rampant cliches in here. Come on, couldn't he have done something a LITTLE more imaginative?And Barron's Merlin is a powerful reimagining of the legendary wizard -- this Merlin is a confused, outcast boy who is terrified of his own dangerous magic. Rhia is a likably quirky supporting character, just odd enough that she seems like a convincing forest baby, and there are a number of eccentric characters -- the Grand Elusa, Domnu and Cairpre -- that really draw in the reader.""The Lost Years"" is a striking, lushly-written fantasy novel that adds new mythical dimensions to our favorite Arthurian wizard.

It picks up pace as the young boy tries to find his history which he has forgotten.The magic element of the book is not wow at the beginning but starts to get interesting once the teenage boy travels to the land between two worlds. As a start to a long saga of books I find it very good. If you are looking for the early years of Merlin to seem conclusive at the end I would say not exactly.

I recently was given Pandemonium, the second book in the trilogy for review, so I thought it would finally get around to writing a review for Delirium. I did a quick re-read to freshen up my memory, not that I really needed to, but honestly I loved this book so I didn't mind! It was one of my favorite books I read this year, and before I go any further, if you haven't read it, you really need to because it is wonderful!!First 50 Pages: Delirium was one of the very first dystopian books that I read besides The Hunger Games and I think that it was the cause of my love for the genre. The first 50 pages of this book really hooked me right in both times I read it and I loved the setting and the premise of the story line. The world Oliver had created wasn't too different from the world we live in now, yet it is still unique. The author uses an amazing amount of detail and her imagery and world-building skills are fantastic. It was so easy to become completely absorbed into the main character, Lena's world. I love dystopians that doesn't seem far-fetched and it was easy for me to visualize most of the things in the story actually happening in real life. So, that is a major plus in my eyes.Characters & Plot: The basic story line revolves around Lena, who feels comfortable in her safe and secure bubble of a government-managed United States. She knows what to expect to happen in her future and everything will be chosen for her: her college, her career, and future husband, and even how many children they will one day have. Once Lena turns 18, she will have a procedure done to cure her of love. Yes, love. In this world, love is a disease and it is thought that it is the cause of just about everything that has ever gone wrong. All people are cured of the love disease, except for people called ""invalids"" or sympathizers of those ""infected"" with the love disease. Lena in the beginning of the story completely believes that love is exactly that, nothing more than a nasty disease that she cannot wait to be completely protected against and she even counts down the days to her own procedure. Lena's mother suffered and died because of the disease, and Lena's worst fear is of turning into her mother, who committed suicide.Then she meets Alex, a strange and kind of mysterious young man close to her own age 95 days before her procedure. In short, everything Lena thought she believed about the world she lived in, and even her own past, is thrown all out of wack. This book isn't fast-paced. It takes its good old time to get going, but I didn't mind because it left plenty of room for world-building and time to connect with each of the characters.I loved the transformation Lena takes in the book! She starts out as a character that really relies on everything being predictable, and she was predictable. She did exactly what she was told with no questions asked. She wasn't a risk taker and she knew, and accepted, what her future would be. She was like a caged animal, in fact, she pretty much was a caged animal. By the end of the book, she is anything but predictable. She takes chances. She has a chance at a real life and she makes her own choices. Were the choices she made the right choices? Well, I guess I will find out in the next book. This book ends with a major cliffhanger that left me screaming for more.I usually don't care for too much romance in books, but this time it was acceptable and expected deeming the circumstances. I loved the chemistry between Lena and Alex and the risks and lengths they take to stay together. It kind of reminded me of William Shakespeare's, ""Romeo and Juliet."" In fact, the play was referred to quite a few times in the story, which I adored because it is one of my all-time favorites.Hana was also an interesting character who makes a great transformation. She, unlike Lena, starts off as a bit of a wild-child. She takes the risks Lena had a hard time taking, and by the end of the book she turns out to be more like Lena was. She was only able to push herself to a certain limit, but she was content with what her future would be in the regulated world. I'm interested to see if she will continue to be on the same path in the next book.Final Thoughts: This book is absolutely incredible. I have nothing negative to say about Delirium, if anything, some people may find the pacing a tad slow but for me it was perfect. I have a feeling that Pandemonium is going to be more action packed because of how Delirium ended. I very, very highly recommend picking this book up!

I feel like I'm the only reviewer who didn't completely fall in love with this book. It was really good, it just didn't pull me in the way it has other readers.The premise was what interested me. There are plenty of dystopians where the society appears perfect because any and all causes of discord are erased from the world, but never has the cause of all this been love. If you think about it, it makes sense. Love and hate influence much of what we do, and have been the cause of many problems in our society. What would the world be like if we erased those things? Would things be better or worse? I don't know, but I don't want to find out!I like the fact that this is set in an alternate-present, instead of a far-away future. I think that's something a lot of people didn't get, but to me it seemed clear that this isn't set sometime in the far future, but that their was a conflict sometime in the past that would've lead to the society being like this by now.Based on what I picked up from the story, the cure had been around for quite some time before Lena's story takes place. Because of this, I wonder how inventions such as the internet came about. Any great invention can't be invented without a passion burning behind it.I found the characters alright, but there wasn't anything to make me love them. Lena seemed kind of shallow. She did whatever she was told, regardless of what she should've done. That wasn't my biggest issue, though.There's a moment towards the end where she says something along the lines of `I only feel beautiful when Alex tells me I am' and that just wrecked her for me. If she doesn't like herself, why should I?The story felt really slow paced. It took 200 pages in before anything exciting happened. I didn't mind that so much. It made some room for world-building and getting to know the characters. After that, the pacing caught up and the story really began to pull me in,  keeping me captivated the whole way through.",Didn't pull me in,Teen & Young Adult,Visit Amazon's Lauren Oliver Page,Delirium (Delirium Trilogy),17356.0,hardcover,3.33

I've not read the book, but I did read the sample and actually fell in love with it....I would LOVE to read this book, I believe I would truly enjoy it!  But, the price is ridiculous!!  I, myself, live on a fixed income, and really can't afford books at this level of pricing, especially when it is part of a series.....add that up after you get into 3 or more books in ONE series!!  Now, let's consider the fact that these books are actually .....YA &#62; Young Adult, meaning they are for Teens!  Tell me, please, what TEENS can afford to purchase such &#34;great&#34; reads at these prices?  I have a grand-daughter, who has her own Kindle and absolutely LOVES reading, and loves reading these types of books (paranormal, Dystopian, Apocalyptic, zombies ....etc...), and there is NO-WAY she can afford these books!!  For Holidays & for her birthday I purchase her an Amazon gift card for her Kindle, to which of course...she calculates how many books she can get!  uh....for books under $5.00 that is!!  She would absolutely love to read books from Authors like Ms. Oliver, but.....the prices of Ms. Oliver's books would &#34;limit' her reading since it would obviously limit the amount of books she'd be able to purchase!  I think this is a shame,....it's one thing that I can't afford to read these books....but I feel bad that my grand-daughter has to choose books by their prices!!  I don't think ANY E-BOOK should cost more than 5 bux!!  Seriously....c'mon people....we are supposed to ENCOURAGE our young to read.....READ READ READ.....but not if you're gonna charge them an arm & a leg for a book!!  Just exactly WHERE do you expect kids to get this kind of money to purchase 3, 4, 5 books in a series at $8.00 a pop??  Surrrre....Mom & Dad can shell that out every time the kid needs a new book to read!!  How about the other kids in the family?  How about when Mom is on disability and can't work and Dad has a &#34;decent&#34; job that brings in enough for a house payment, car payment, house utilities and food on the table!!  How about when there isn't &#34;extra&#34; money to dish out to one child for books at these prices??  And....how about the fact that Mom has her own kindle and loves reading just as much if not MORE than her young teenage daughter (which in this case is MORE! lol ) and they can't even LEND books to each other, or me to them....because .....oh yea, books at these higher prices don't have Lending enabled!!?!?  Go figure!!  Oh, and for those &#34;smart&#34; ones out there that will probably reply in some &#34;smart / sarcastic&#34; way....yes, they do share their Kindles with each other....but that is NOT my point here....I could Lend books with them, or them to me.....IF it was enabled.  pfft!So, there's my reason for my 2 star rating, and there's what I like and dislike about the book and HERE is who I'd recommend this book to ~~~~~&#62; Rich kids, people with money, people that don't care about tossing out 50 bux to purchase E-books......E-BOOKS!!  Oh, and let's not forget when THIS particular book was published!!  And they're STILL charging Young Adults, Teens, Adults....way, WAY over $5.00 for each book in the series!!  Not that the price would be right if the book just came out, but maybe I could understand a little....but not when the book came out almost 10 years ago and the Kindle price is STILL $8.00 or more!!

A few times it even switched to omniscient.  This was not only annoying, but extremely distracting.Also, one character seems to have some kind of secret that the author didn't want us to know, I assume until the end.  However, some of the story was even told from her viewpoint. Now, if you are basically in someone's mind, wouldn't you know their secret?One other point was that the emotions of the characters just seemed extreme. The main character would go from smiling & joking to an almost murderous rage from one sentence to the next. And, yet, no one seemed to notice his extreme emotional instability. They even referred to his 'boyish charm' or something like that.He seemed to me to be extremely emotionally unstable.

I liked Henry, and I thought his living arrangements had a lot of potential in subsequent books (and boy, would I like his house!).  I also liked the amount of detail that was given. Another reviewer referred to it as 'padding'.  Maybe it is, but I also liked the way it gave the story immediacy - you felt like you were right there, watching the goings-on.  The concept of a retired police chief helping out with current cases is no more or less implausible than most of the premises for most mysteries.  All things considered, most police departments nowadays would jump on the chance to have an expert, unpaid, consultant available!  I thought that the plot was interesting, the victim just 'shady' enough to be realistic.  My big gripe, if it can be called that, was with the ending when the murderer was revealed.  I don't necessarily dislike the author's decision on who should be First Murderer, but I didn't like the way he presented it - it was too sudden, too abrupt, and the clues leading to their identity were a bit too subtle and got lost in the shuffle, so to speak. If the author had eased Henry into his realization of who the murderer was more gradually and provided one more clue that pointed to that person, I think the ending would've been immeasureably improved.  All in all, this was a pleasant, easy read with a bit of a twist at the end.  I'd recommend it.Note on Kindle formatting:  Good.

Jim's  life of acceptance of growing old, and his prospects for the future not the best for a man his age, melted away in an instant of sentement and memory at the loss of his friend. Jim's mental gears start to turn slowly as he ponders why the dead person had reached out to him in her final moments of life: Him,the class nerd, him the shy unassuming class photographer, him, always invited, but never missed if he didn't show. A cunning and methodical mind is quickly revealed as he searches for answers. When the second classmate is murdered, Jim is up to his not-so-slim waist in mystery and intrigue, always two steps behind the murderer. When the body of a third friend shows up, Jim has picked up enough clues through bird dog tenacity,and a hound's sense of smelling out trouble,that he has a suspect in his sights and is zeroing in for the bust. Suddenly, the hunt turns and Jim is the target, possibly the next victim, or so he suspects, but the real target is the new love in his life, Penny, the girl that had a secret crush on Jim when they were in High School. Jim is caught off guard that such a beauty would have any interest in him, backin the day, and even now, when she reveals her long hidden secret of love for Jim. In spite of this new-found love late in life, Jim stays focused on finding the murderer.

Lesley ""(Judy)""",4.0,2010,"This short story concerns a man who reports to Inspector Rutledge that his daughter was kidnapped outside their home as they returned from a dinner engagement.  With one clue uncovered in the investigation Rutledge sets about apprehending the culprits.  Indeed, this was quite short, but very entertaining for all that.  It has the deft Charles Todd touch which these authors normally give Rutledge for picking up on clues.  Hamish does not make an appearance in this story.Excerpts ofA Lonely Death: An Inspector Ian Rutledge Mystery (Inspector Ian Rutledge Mysteries)which will be released in January 2011,The Red Door: An Inspector Rutledge Mystery (Ian Rutledge Mysteries), andA Pale Horse: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Ian Rutledge Mysteries)are included along with a brief biography of the two authors.  I think I would probably consider this story another sample of the writing talents which make the Inspector Ian Rutledge series so popular with mystery novel enthusiasts.

While the premise did sound interesting, I just felt that it was not going to be something I could really get my heart into.  Mistake...  I read it straight through, staying up until the wee hours of the morning - on a work night!  I very much enjoyed picking out the correlations between characters in this book and the ones in Lewis Carroll's 'Alice'.  Not all were obvious.  I also found the 'substory' of a lonely, depressed woman's experience with Internet romance to be sadly accurate.  The author portrayed the emotional roller-coaster of Alice's romance with Nigel and her unfortunate credulity all too well, and this should be required reading for anyone who is participating in online dating (or thinking of doing so).  Don't get me wrong - this was a very clever, quirky, and laugh-out-loud story, but it did  have a tale to tell and a warning to convey, however humorously.

I thought the first book (Blind Malice) in the series borderline on length (1800 locations) and chose to try this, the second, but have been disappointed by its brevity.

The BIG problem with this book, aside from some Kindle formatting issues, which you can overlook easily enough, was that it was written so badly in terms of grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc.I don't think that details regarding what someone does in the bathroom were needed, or one of the accused ""scratching"" himself, or an attorney pleasuring himself, by himself, they were so unnecessary, that they really detracted from the story and simply didn't belong.The title leads you to believe that right from the start there's a vigilante at work.  I was 44% into the book before the first vigilante act took place, so the description of the book is a little misleading.I enjoyed the book, and it gets you interested immediately and keeps you interested throughout the book.  It had twists and turns, most of which were unexpected, but it was incredibly hard to get past the elementary level of writing.  If you're going to write a book that you want people to read and enjoy, and you want those same readers to ""spread the word"" to others, and possibly read additional books you might write, for goodness sake, write it well, turn on spell check and proof, proof, proof.  I was astounded at the poor use of grammer, the use of incorrect words, the punctuation was atrocious, and many times I find that reading books written like this almost make you nauseous.I hate to blast the basic writing style, but it is hard to enjoy a book when these things are rampant throughout the story.

It's about a con woman/thief who accidentally burglarizes the house of a serial killer.  He comes home while she's there and then the real action starts.  In his sick mind, she is the one who got away so he must kill her.  And the people she cares about.Delilah is an interesting new character.  She's not only a crook; she's a mother who gave up her child and never sees other friends and family because she is unable to connect to anybody.  Yet somehow she's sympathetic and I wanted her to be okay-she gets run through the mill in this one.  Would like to see more back story about her-there were hints about her past and how she became what she is but not enough to completely understand her.  And I would have really liked to see more of the Sam character, a burnt out detective who comes slightly re-alive after he meets Delilah in a bar, but is never fully involved.

Altair and his wife Apple run Tantricity Hill.  The other three couples are Arnold and Missy, Debra and Devon, and Helena and Blake.  Each couple has their own reason for visiting Tantricity Hill.  Tantricity Hill is a retreat, focusing on sex therapy and allowing campers to reconnect with themselves as well as their significant others.  During their time, they each explore their minds, bodies, and sexuality.  They are able to try new things without distractions.  The first half of the book, we get to know each character.  We find out who they are, why they are there and what they hope to find and explore.During a drug filled orgy in the dark, one camper takes advantage and kills another.  Later in the book, it will be revealed as to why this person killed.  As a group, they decide to bury the body.  They dig the grave together, wrap the body, and bury it.  As you can imagine, they are left in shock and full of guilt.About halfway through the book, we meet the main character, Bud Warhol.  It is now 2008, 21 years after they buried the body.  The body is discovered.  Bud is an anthropologist who works with the police to determine if it's a murder or historical burial site.  We follow Bud on his quest to find the campers from that weekend.This book was an interesting read from start to finish, it was unlike any book I have ever read.  I was surprised Bud was able to find everyone involved with the murder so quickly.  Bud was smart and resourceful for getting the information he needed to solve the case.  I was also surprised at how open and honest the campers were when Bud came to question them.  I think the guilt  from all those years ago just ate them up.  Someone had to tell the truth about what happened.  While they were all involved with the cover up, they were honest after the truth was told.

It really reminded me of a Myron Bolitar book.The comparison to Harlen comes from having read his early works which did not exhibit the polish his writing does now, as I would not expect polish from a first time writer. Compare to Myron? Yeah. Ridley's got the attitude, he's got the brains (when he's thinking with the big head, not the little head). No, he doesn't have anywhere near as awesome a side kick as Winston Lock-Horne, but maybe further novels will either add a side kick or have Ridley continue on his own. I could easily see his geeky computer pal from high school filling the side kick role.I did think I'd had the who-dun-it figured out a couple of times so the actual culprit did take me by surprise.

Many authors of Amazon do this, making a short work available for free or a low price. However, Levine (or whoever wrote his Kindle blurb) is very deceptive in portraying just what someone who's going to buy the book will receive.Sink or Swim is a short story that also appears in another Levine short story collection called The Road to Hell. There, it went by the title To Hell and Back. Under either title, the story features Solomon and Lord, the mismatched attorneys who are the protagonists of one of Levine's two main series. Victoria Lord believes in playing by the book (and the law), while Steve Solomon has at best a nodding acquaintance with legal ethics, which he won't let stand in the way of justice. In this story, the pair's client, an elderly business woman who is a Cuban refugee in South Florida, has been swindled out of a lot of money by a fellow refugee who helped manage her books and then helped himself to the business' assets. Solomon has two problems: he can't locate the missing money or prove the man actually stole it. So he agrees to go on a deep sea fishing trip with the con man which soon turns into a deadly cat-and-mouse game. Readers won't learn much about Solomon and Lord as characters here, but the confrontation between lawyers (Lord is also on the boat) and con man is quite dramatic with a couple of unexpected plot twists.Had this story appeared by itself as a Kindle selection, I would have given it 3 1/2 stars, with a caveat that readers have to decide whether a good short story is worth the price asked. However, the story actually comprises less than 20% of the advertised 130 pages of the book. The remainder of the book (82% according to my Kindle) consists of lengthy excerpts from four Solomon and Lord novels, and a fifth novel featuring Levine's other main character Jake Lassiter. I didn't read these excerpts and I don't base this review on them. However, if I wanted to read those five novels, I would have gotten the books instead of reading a couple of chapters here.The blurb on the Amazon web site does call this material ""excerpts"" but neglects to mention that the excerpts occupy the vast majority of the book. It's the equivalent of going to a three hour movie and watching a 30-minute TV episode and a whole bunch of trailers. In my view, this is deceptive, especially if the author charges for the book (I did get my copy for free but I believe it has been offered for sale at various times). People may be willing to spend money for a 100+ page novella but not a 20-page story with over 100 pages of filler. Further, by giving the book's only complete work, the short story formerly called To Hell and Back, a new name, readers who already read the story in another collection might think they were getting something new here.To be fair, I don't know whether this marketing strategy was Levine's idea or his publisher's. However, no matter whose idea it is Paul Levine (or his publisher) does his audience a disservice by not being straightforward in describing what's actually in this book. In this case, my recommendation would be not to pay one cent for this book that has not one single page of new material. If you are interested in the story, read Levine's other collection (which itself is somewhat deceptively described) which, if you have to pay some money, at least gives you four stories with a bunch of filler instead of one rehash with even more filler.",This One Sinks Due to Deceptive Marketing,"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense",Visit Amazon's Paul Levine Page,SOLOMON &amp; LORD SINK OR SWIM (Solomon vs. Lord) - Kindle edition,10207.0,kindle,2.33

He's succeeded for two decades in suppressing what happened in the woods, why would this time be any different.The positives are that I really liked Rob as a character. I thought that telling the story from his point of view was absolutely the correct choice. I also really enjoyed the author's writing style. It worked for this type of story.On the other hand, I thought that most of the mystery of the new murder was easily solved. While I didn't get all the details right, I knew enough of how it would finish very early in the book. Also, while I started out liking Cassie, by the end I was very disappointed in her character and how she handled what were obviously very traumatic events for her partner. Finally, the book jacket leads you to believe that Rob will unearth just what happened to him and his friends. I'm not sure if it was intentionally misleading or not, but I was very frustrated to learn that this part of the crime goes completely unsolved.Overall, I liked the book and I am interested in giving Tana French another try.

I blazed through this book in just a couple sittings, but that doesn't mean it's an amazing book, it just has some really good hooks.Sphere is about a group of scientists from all walks of life (zoologist, psychologist, an astrophysicist and others) and their secret mission into the depths of the Pacific Ocean.

I started as many readers with the more modern day stories and then I went back and read the famous, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.  Comparing the earlier Le Carre to the later day author is night and day.  So I decided to start at the beginning - Call for the Dead.George Smiley is introduced to us in this book.  He is not the supreme spymaster at this point that he becomes later.  Some may argue this point, as his storied heroics from WWII are on display.  But he is not so confident of his skills or his governmental position.  His personal strife with the divorce of his wife Ann is described and this adds to his personality.  Smiley is not the king of the Secret World at this point and his inexperience is fun to see.The story is very short on pages, but not on important developments.  At this stage of Le Carre's career, he could say much with few words.  The characters are surprisingly well developed in 128 pages.  The intricacies of the storyline are well thought out and the ending, if not totally surprising, is explained in detail - something that doesn't happen so often in Le Carre's later writings.I found myself wired in to this story for no other reason that I felt I was watching the manifestations of some of the most famous spy characters in history - Mundt and Smiley.  I can't say that the story is so twisted that the reader can't figure it out, but I will say that the writing is so well done, that you can't help but read every word.  The reader can begin to see the mind of Le Carre as he takes a simple plotline and attempts to weave it a myriad of ways.If you've liked the later books, treat yourself to this one - the creation.",Introduction of Smiley and Mundt - Classic,"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense",Visit Amazon's John le Carr&eacute; Page,Call for the Dead: A George Smiley Novel,33300.0,hardcover,4.5

Doornbos,5.0,2010,"Today, John Le Carr&eacute; is very much a living writer: in his early 80s, all his twenty or more books are still in print and he is still producing. His success is due to a large extent to a series of spy novels starring an anti-hero, George Smiley(GS), who is short and pudgy, bespectacled, wearing expensive, but badly-cut suits and coats (""His tailor is robbing him!""). He has three loves: Ann, his aristocratic but wayward wife, his job and neglected German romantic poetry from the 17th and 18th century. The book conveniently starts with a chapter about the history of GS.This slim volume is Le Carr&eacute;'s debut, written, along with his next two novels, while working for the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Germany, Switzerland, and perhaps elsewhere, in a more mobile capacity. It is situated in London around 1960, when the German Democratic Republic`s foothold in GB was not an embassy (no Western country recognized it then), but the East German Steel Mission.GS is asked to vet a Foreign Office staffer against whom anonymous accusations have been made. The pair spend hours together talking, mostly outdoors in a park, in a good-natured way. The next morning, before dawn, Smiley is called to rush to the diplomat's home. He has shot himself. His suicide note claims that the interview went badly and he cannot live with the pressure anymore...For older readers the availability of this debut and all other Smiley-books is an opportunity to re-read  the saga from start to finish, in the right order. Younger generations will miss lots of gadgets (mobile phones, PCs and laptops, even central heating), but may like Le Carr&eacute;'s lifelong emphasis on human intelligence.

If it is not as polished as LeCarre's later masterpieces of espionage fiction, it is certainly an authentic Cold War story with a twisting plot and a cynical take on the spy business.  Perhaps its most important feature is that it introduces George Smiley, agent of the British Secret Intelligence Service, who would go on to feature in many of LeCarre's later novels.As the story opens, a British Foreign Office civil servant named Samuel Fennan apparently commits suicide, just hours after being cleared for duty in a routine security investigation.  The security investigator, George Smiley, wonders why.  Interviews with Fennan's widow and with Inspector Mendal of the police provide Smiley with an important clue, one on which the case turns.  Ignoring the directions of his superior, Smiley determines to get to the bottom of the case.  His pursuit will bring him up against the hard edge of a ruthless East German intelligence network and its deadly tactics.""Call for the Dead"" is highly recommended to fans of LeCarre's espionage fiction, who are likely to find it both an entertaining read and a nice setup for later novels.",Call for George Smiley...,"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense",Visit Amazon's John le Carr&eacute; Page,Call for the Dead: A George Smiley Novel,33300.0,hardcover,4.5

The underlying plot and the solution and reasoning the Poirot comes up with is rather fascinating, but the retrospective format of the book makes it a tough read at times. I am a Christie fan, but this is certainly not one of her better books.In this book Poirot is engaged by a young lady whose mother was convicted of murdering her father some years ago. The child grew up with relatives, and was too young to remember the incident at the time. When she comes of age, she finds out the ""truth"" and wants Poirot to clear her mothers name before she gets married. The reminder of the book is mostly composed of either written accounts of the murder, or interviews with the principal characters. The problem is that much of the information is almost given twice, in that Poirot interviews the subjects, and then has them provide a written account. The book moves slowly, and is really not very interesting even when Christie throws out some obvious clues. The one thing about this book is that the mystery is very solvable by the reader. I head guessed at least some of the major points before the classic Poirot wrap-up. I did, however, still find the final solution interesting and Poirot's reasoning interesting as well.Overall, not a great Poirot book, but not a waste of time!","A Little Slow, But A Nice Deduction by Poirot","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense",Visit Amazon's Agatha Christie Page,Five Little Pigs: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Hercule Poirot Mysteries),41445.0,hardcover,4.5

Not only is the murder victim long dead, but the convicted murderer is dead too. However Poirot has no doubt that he can use his little grey cells to get to the truth.Hercule Poirot always has a soft spot for a young lady in distress or peril. In his previous appearance in EVIL UNDER THE SUN he had great admiration for the female murderer. In FIVE LITTLE PIGS he has great sympathy with Carla Crale's belief in her mother's innocence.It is Poirot himself who names this case:A jingle ran through Poirot's head. He repressed it. He must not always be thinking of nursery rhymes. It seemed an obsession with him lately. And yet the jingle persisted. `This little pig went to market, this little pig stayed at home...'The structure of FIVE LITTLE PIGS is deceptively simple. In Book I there are ten chapters. In the first five Poirot interviews the officials involved in the court cases to see what they remember and what their impression was of Caroline Crale's guilt. In the next five chapters he interviews the five people who were present when the murder happened.In Book II each of the latter five gives Poirot a written narrative of events and their own opinion of whether Caroline Crale was guilty of murder.Book III also has five chapters. Poirot brings the five people together with Carla Crale and her fiance. He asks a question each of those who gave him a narrative and then reconstructs what happened as he sees it, pointing out that one of those present has lied, and some of the others are mistaken in their interpretation of what they saw and heard at the time.For readers it is a most satisfying book because you have the same opportunities as Hercule Poirot to reinterpret the evidence and to look for the flaws in the narratives. I must admit to at first following the red herring that Christie so temptingly laid across my path. I always had an alternative reconstruction lurking in the back of my mind though, and that proved to be the correct one.This was the last novel of an especially prolific phase of Christie's work on Poirot. She published thirteen Poirot novels between 1935 and 1942 out of a total of eighteen novels in that period. By contrast, she published only two Poirot novels in the next eight years, indicating the possibility that she was experiencing some frustration with her most popular character.

Mais voyons, I made a faux pas that Hercule never would have done, now I'm talking gobbledegook! Once again Agatha Christie entertains the reader with the great Belgian detective who lives in England and loves to speak French. This time Hercule Poirot  relies on a little epistolary to solve this sixteen year old crime. I say faugh to the murderer in this 1943 novel. I cheated, the word faugh was used in this novel by Agatha, and it is a interjection meaning ' expressed contemp!'Our favorite detective is asked by a convicted murderess's daughter to investigate whether her mother killed her father. Apparently before Carla Lemarchant's ( nee Crale) mother died in prison, she wrote Carla ( then five years old ) a letter stating that she was innocent of the murder of her husband and Carla's father, the artist Amyas Crale. Carla, brought up by a Canadian family for the ensuing sixteen years, gets the letter when she turns 21 years old. Her fiance is upset that he is possibly marrying the daughter of a murderess. Carla wants to find out the truth in order to facilitate their fears. Poirot decides to take the case using the pretense that he is writing and, or editing a book about famous past murders. Did Caroline Crale really poison her artist husband sixteen years earlier? The jury believed she did and sentenced her to life in prison, but she died shortly after the conviction.There are five suspects ( little pigs ) that our 5' 4"" sleuth zeroes in on. They include Amyas Crale's best friend Philip Blake and his brother Meredith Blake, Crale's lover Elsa Greer, the governess Cecillia Williams, and Caroline's disfigured sister Angela Warren. He interviews each suspect and then ask them to put their recollections in the form of a letter to him so he can clear up any ambiguities before the book is published. Needless to say, Hercule summons the five suspects together at Meredith Blake's house and to their surprise he solves the murder case.I think what makes Agatha's novels intriguing is the way Hercule Poirot solves murders. He really doesn't rely on clues, but instead he arrives at a decision by pure reasoning and only then does he draw a logical conclusion. In his own words he states "" My success, let me tell you, has been founded on the psychology- the eternal why? of human behaviour."" He is the forerunner of later detectives such as,'The Thin Man' and 'Columbo' .

The book may be found separately or in Berlin Noir, the compilation of all three books.March Violets is set in the darkening days of Hitler's Germany; the 1936 Olympics are just coming to town. Kerr's protagonist, Bernard Gunther, is a private detective hired by a very wealthy conservative (i.e. non-Nazi) German industrialist to find out who murdered his daughter and her Nazi husband, burned down their home, and stole a diamond necklace from their safe.Kerr's tale gets a bit convoluted and he is prone to excessive flights of language (usually intended to be funny, but falling flat to this reader). Kerr excels in recreating the complex world of Berlin, one of Europe's most cosmopolitan cities as it is being smothered by the Nazis. Gunther is an ex-cop and we meet his former police colleagues, several colorful underworld characters, and a number of revolting Nazis, too. (Although even among the Nazis, there are levels of malevolence; Goering is on one level, Himmler on another one altogether.). Gunther also falls into bed with beautiful women with an ease sure to make most men jealous.By the way, the title refers to the numerous new members the Nazi party gained after leveraged its 1933 electoral victory into total control of the German government. Older Nazis derided these latecomers as ""March Violets.""An intelligent and entertaining tale that makes one want to read the second volume.

Recreating 1936 Berlin, Kerr creates a mystery at the heart of which is his hard-boiled private investigator, Bernie Gunther. Gunther's gift is his fearlessness in the face of utter terror, a society run by thugs with no hope of deliverance in sight. Gunther literally doesn't care if he lives or dies, and this enables him to escape any number of near-death encounters from the Gestapo to the local police to gangs and hired killers. It doesn't take long to know that the story is not going to end well for many, the only comfort being Bernie first-person narrative that suggests his survival.

Jackson,3.0,2011,"The Little Drummer Girl has one glaring deficiency: the basis upon which the story rests is false.The novel's antagonist, named Khalil, is a 'Palestinian' freedom fighter who doesn't want the 'Palestinian People' to wait 2,000 years, like the Jews waited, for the restoration of their 'homeland'. Khalil runs a highly effective terrorist network that bombs Israeli targets throughout Europe in order to advertise the 'Palestinian' cause.John le Carr&eacute; bases his story on the false historical claim that there is such an ethnic group called the 'Palestinians'. The only 'Palestinians' to have existed were citizens of the 1922 League of Nations' 'Mandate for Palestine', the Jewish Homeland. The term 'Palestinian' was only used for legal purposes to describe those living in the Jewish Homeland between 1922-1948. As such, Jews were also defined as 'Palestinians'. When Israel became a state in 1948 (changing its name from Palestine to Israel. The name Palestine was given to the territory in 135 AD by Emperor Hadrian as an insult to the Jews, who had just revolted against Roman rule for a second time. Palestine is the Romanized version of the name Philistine, the land of Israel's ancient enemies), the term 'Palestinian' became defunct, but was then co-opted by Arab governments and used to fool ignorant observers that the 'Palestinians' had lost their land to the Jews. John le Carr&eacute; presents the 'Palestinians' as an actual ethnic group with justified land claims against the Jewish state, when in fact there never was a 'Palestinian' ethnic group present in the Middle East. And here's the proof of the Arab governments' lie: Unless those who take the anti-Israeli side in this discussion can produce what should be the easy to find documents from the early 1920s where the 'Palestinian People' are demanding their state and being denied their demands by the League of Nations, then you have just proved to yourselves that the 'distinct Palestinian People' canard is just that-a canard.The Little Drummer Girl does have one saving grace, however, and that revolves around the Mossad recruitment of 'Charlie', an unknown actress with Vanessa Redgrave-like politics. Due to the latest bombing by Khalil of an Israeli target in Bad Godesberg, the Mossad must quickly neutralize Khalil and his network or else the politicians in Israel and the IDF will take matters into their own hands, which means indiscriminate reprisal attacks on Arab (not 'Palestinian') refugee camps, resulting in the deaths of women and children and another black eye for Israel in the court of world opinion.On the trail of the elusive Khalil is the Mossad's best operative-Kurtz, and his Mossad team. Kurtz's plan: use Charlie to infiltrate Khalil's network and hope to luck that once inside Khalil can be found.",Story based on a misnomer,"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense",Visit Amazon's John le Carr Page,The Little Drummer Girl: A Novel,31336.0,hardcover,3.75

The plot is basic: a young, suburban family of four have been murdered in their home.  The twist?  The house is in a nearly abandoned complex, its falling apart at the seams, and there are large holes bashed into all the walls - with video monitors pointing into the darkness.  Did the family tear apart their own home?  Were they being stalked?  Or was it simply some vermin hiding out in a wall?  Detective Michael ""Scorcher"" Kennedy is your stereotypical obnoxious, hard-assed cop; an unlovable character from the very first page.  Scorcher, teamed with a younger, kinder and gentler detective, travels from Dublin to the scene of a massive childhood trauma, Broken Harbor (now called Brianstown), in search of an explanation for this seemingly schizophrenic situation.  The result is, well, slow.  And its not just the largely unlikable main characters that make this book a painful read: it's the leisurely plot development and lack of action that make this story seem to last far longer than its nearly 500 pages.  For those that seek some action in their mysteries, this is definitely not going to be the read for you!  French takes a conversation-driven approach to her plot, meaning that her characters are going to talk and talk a lot.  It's not an altogether bad approach, unfortunately coupled with a slim plot and a whole lot of unlovable characters, this novel just feels like an exercise in endurance for the reader.  Reward yourself if you can survive to the unsatisfying end!","Unlikable characters, slow and unsatisfying plot","Mystery, Thriller & Suspense",Visit Amazon's Tana French Page,Broken Harbor: A Novel (Dublin Murder Squad),15170.0,hardcover,3.33

Rhoades,4.0,2013,"Mick ""Scorcher"" Kennedy and his new partner Richie Curran get called out to investigate a brutal crime in a crumbling, failed, mostly empty housing estate. Two children are dead, smothered in their beds. The unemployed father is dead of multiple stab wounds and the mother is barely alive and unconscious.The detectives immediately find more strange and unsettling things at the Spain house. There are holes smashed in the walls, with video cameras pointed at the holes and at the hatch to the attic (which is covered with wire, as if to keep something from getting out). The wife had confided in her sister that she thought an intruder had been entering the house unobserved over the past few months. And someone has set up an observation post in the empty house across the street so as to watch the place.It's the slow peeling away of the layers of this mystery that keeps the reader fascinated and engaged. If you're looking for an edge of your seat, ""who will survive and what will be left of them"" thriller with the heroes in danger at every turn, this is not the book for you. The drama and conflict comes in the interaction of the characters and in their personal lives, particularly Mick's travails with his mentally unbalanced sister Dina and the memories they both carry of their mother's suicide at the beach resort that was replaced by the development where the murders took place. This means that the book sometimes gets a little slow and talky. I also had trouble swallowing one of Richie's decisions, one that's the setup for the major reveal. It just didn't seem like something that character would do.But, as always with Tana French, the prose is absolutely beautiful--I stopped to read the soliloquy at the beginning of Chapter 18 three times because it was so perfect, even though I knew there was a major turning point about to happen. And the ending was absolutely shattering.

For the first time all of the short stories (including the Labours of Hercules) are included in this short story collection.This short story collection was definitely worth the price for me, all in all it was 899 pages for $11.99. This included a short foreword by Charles Todd that was only about 2 pages and then we go into each short story. At the beginning of every chapter there is a quick blurb on when the story was initially published.There are a total of 51 short stories here and my top five favorite stories (though I did love them all) were the following:1) The Adventure of Johnny Waverly-a father and mother come to Poirot to help when their young son is kidnapped.2) Wasps' Nest-Poirot visits an old friend and attempts to stop a murder.3) The Third Floor Flat-A group of friends are locked out of a flat and two men attempt to gain access by climbing through a dumbwaiter shaft. Unfortnately they find a dead woman. Poirot is on the scene and quickly resolves who murdered the woman and why.4) Triangle at Rhodes-While on vacation Poirot attempts to warn a woman to leave the island she is staying at with her husband.5) The Mystery of the Baghdad Chest-A dead body is found in a chest and Poirot is called upon to investigate.I have loved Agatha Christie since I read ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" and I have to say that no matter what and how carefully I read I never get the guilty party until Poirot laids out what happened and why.Definitely recommend to others!",Perfect for Hercule Poirot Fans (5 stars),"Mystery, Thriller & Suspense",Visit Amazon's Agatha Christie Page,Hercule Poirot: The Complete Short Stories: A Hercule Poirot Collection with Foreword by Charles Todd (Hercule Poirot Mysteries),8471.0,hardcover,5.0

Chambers,4.0,2011,"I purchased ""Up the Down Volcano"" by Sloane Crosley because I like to read Kindle Singles, and the story had a high sales ranking. Frankly, at the time, I knew nothing about the author, so I looked her up and learned that Sloane Crosley is a writer living in New York and the author of the bestselling collections of essays, ""I Was Told There'd Be Cake"" and ""How Did You Get This Number.""""Up the Down Volcano"" was an interesting story about the author's trip to Quito, Ecuador on assignment from a travel magazine. While there, she decided to climb Cotopaxi, a volcanic peak in the Andes Mountains. It turned out to be a bit more grueling than she imagined, and having a guide who only spoke a few words of English didn't help.The story was funny, in a painful sort of way. There are real dangers in mountain climbing, not the least of which is altitude sickness, as Ms. Sloane quickly learned. She did a skillful job of writing humor into situations that were far from funny at the time.It was a good story and a good introduction to Ms. Crosley's writing. The story was written in the present tense, a style that I don't particularly care for, but it's a legitimate writing style.Overall, it was a pretty good story.",A pretty good story,Humor & Entertainment,Visit Amazon's Sloane Crosley Page, Up the Down Volcano (Kindle Single) eBook,336809.0,kindle,4.0

Gertie and her group of investigators, The Trouble Busters, naturally chose to do community service. The Trouble Busters, possibly considered to be The Trouble Makers by the judge, is a group of three ""older"" women who have been charged with obstructing justice. Living with her 92 year old mother-in-law, Gertie has a secret motive for suggesting they do their time at the assisted living home in Trenary, in the Michigan Upper Peninsula. She is hoping Grandma, her late husband's mother, will like it so much she will elect to move there, especially since an old boy-friend Earl is there, so she has included in her group of forced volunteers her thorn-in-the-side mother-in-law, and Gertie's companion dog Fred, a German Shepherd. An ex-police dog, he is easily the most capable member of the investigators.What they don't realize until already committed to volunteering there, is that Earl is a joker with a nasty bent. Being served ""chocolate"" candies that turn out to have a distinct odour that he ""made"" himself, it doesn't take long to decide this choice was not particularly a good idea. Unfortunately for this zany group, they are stranded there when they are cut off from escape by a huge snowstorm. The staff takes advantage of the new arrivals to take a day off, leaving them almost solely responsible for the residents and under the watch of the intolerable head of the facility, Nurse Shrank, a seriously scary thought.With a mixed bag of equally zany residents including a former mailman deathly afraid of dogs, and Nurse Shrank, a nightmare waiting to happen, the fun begins. When Gertie discovers a body in the basement she knows this definitely was a bad idea. With the phone lines down and a raging snowstorm isolating them, they are stuck with whatever is going on. Definitely not where anyone wants to spend Christmas! Especially when almost everyone falls into a deep sleep after lunch, including the staff and Fred. Deb Baker has concocted a very unusual and funny holiday mystery with her group of protagonists. This novella can be read quickly and the antics of the characters will entertain. How the inmates of the assisted living pull off their stunts as well as cotton on to what is going on that shouldn't be at Applegate, better known as Hellsgate by Gertie, is quirky yet intelligent. I enjoyed this romp of a mystery and the ""volunteer"" group.

If his name rings a small bell, that's probably because he was portrayed by Ben Kingsley in the 1993 filmSearching For Bobby Fischer, which was based on the book of the same name by Fred Waitzkin.

I've also been using an older Kindle Touch to create a traveling library that has Kindle books for each age group, and then Kindle books aimed at each individual grandchild, (by interests or just because the hero or heroine has the same name and it's fun to read about somebody who has your name). Anyway, I just never paid attention to joke books until one of the kids started telling me Knock Knock jokes, about half of which he understood and all of which he thought were hysterical.So I thought, ""hey, joke books"". The words are basic and the sentences are simple. The word play can be sort of obvious, but it's still word play and it can sometimes be very clever. Knock Knock and answer and response jokes are actually interactive, since you take turns being the straight man. For a pre-reader or a brand new reader joke books can be the perfect way to have fun with books and words.Here, the jokes are mostly in the ""Question and Answer"" style, e.g. ""What do you call a...?, Why did the ...? Where do you keep a ...?"" That's great because a question builds up excitement for the punchline payoff, and half the time the kid gets the joke and the other half he giggles anyway because the joke is still fun as long as you try to sell it.And these are pretty good jokes, split about evenly between puns, (""Where does a sheep get a haircut? - the Baa Baa shop), and more advanced jokes.So, all in all these particular books strike me as very good examples of the form, and very much worth considering for your little reader. At the least, they should be good for a few nice laughs. Please note that I found this book while browsing Amazon Kindle freebies.

If this question gives you a headache, buy some pain-relievers and pick up Thomas Cathcart and Daniel Klein's bestseller about ""understanding philosophy through jokes.""  For those who know very little about philosophy, this work will probably not be particularly enlightening.  In fact, after reading it, you are bound to be more confused than ever about such topics as metaphysics, epistemology, existentialism, and teleology.However, for philosophy students who are already familiar with their subject, this book will be a hoot, because Cathcart and Klein show the interconnectedness between philosophy and jokes.  According to the authors, ""the construction and payoff of jokes and the construction and payoff of philosophical concepts are made out of the same stuff.""  Both ""confound our sense of the way things are, flip our worlds upside down, and ferret out hidden, often uncomfortable, truths about life.""  That may be true, but most laymen will gloss over the tidbits about Kant, Leibniz, and Kierkegaard, and concentrate on the cartoons and gags.  You may wish to note that there are two off-color jokes on pages 39-41 that are so laugh-out-loud funny that my co-workers fell off their chairs with tears in their eyes when they heard them.To get serious for a moment, ""Plato and a Platypus"" does have some educational content.  For instance, we learn that empiricism posits that the ""objective world is all in the mind,"" whereas ""a priori"" ideas come to us from prior experience and cannot be confirmed or denied by observable evidence.  If you didn't already know that Schopenhauer was a ""kvetcher (griper)"" for whom ""life is a constant cycle of frustration and boredom,"" you will discover that fact in these pages.  Nor is Eastern philosophy neglected.  Did you know that a ""koan"" is a riddle story that is designed to shock the student into a state of ""satori--sudden enlightment?""  An example of this is:  ""What is the sound of one hand clapping?""  Huh?  How can one hand clap?  Thinking about this unanswerable conundrum will, it is hoped, catapult you into ""a profound appreciation of the unity of the universe.""  If not, just read some more jokes.This is a light work of non-fiction with plentiful humor that ranges from corny to very amusing.  In the back of the book there is a philosophy timeline and a helpful glossary.  Cathcart and Klein also include a list of suggested reading and an index for those who want to learn more about a particular subject or philosopher.  ""Plato and a Platypus"" is lighthearted fun, but if you were to give most readers a quiz (essays or short answers, it doesn't matter), most would probably flunk, both empirically and existentially.

This is a 1971 gem of American fiction, the unapologetic and unadorned chronicle of Hank Chinaski, a middle aged derelict living for drinking, screwing, and betting the ponies.  He is also a US Post Office worker.  In prose that is raw, crude, and shockingly blunt, ""The Post Office"" is an important cultural snapshot of the sixties, a reflection of an America torn by an unpopular war, a country focused on challenging authority from all sources - but especially any authority associated with government - an early primer in ""taking it to the man.""  There are no likable characters in this heavily autobiographic rant, and no real plot - this is simply the uncut reflections and ramblings of the bona fide employee from hell - the rebel without a cause who is a nightmare eclipsed only by the Kafkaesque federal bureaucracy and sadist bosses of his employment.  ""The Post Office"" has little if any social redeeming value, but it is refreshingly unpretentious.

What hasn't changed is the hopelessness of today's workers faced with ever-increasing demands for greater production while at the same time not even knowing if the job you have today will even exist tomorrow.

At the time he directed two films - ""House of Games"" (1987) and ""Things Change"" (1988). He would go on to make several more - ""Homicide"" (1991), ""Oleanna"" (1994), ""The Spanish Prisoner"" (1997), ""The Winslow Boy"" (1999), ""Catastrophe"" (2000), ""State and Main"" (2000), ""Heist"" (2001), ""Spartan"" (2004), and ""Redbelt"" (2008).For none of his dozen films as a director has he received any award or nomination, although his work as a screenwriter has received many awards, including two best screenplay Oscar and Golden Globe nominations (""Way the Dog"", ""The Verdict"") and 4 WGA nominations (""The Verdict"", ""The Untouchables"", ""Glengarry Glen Ross"", and ""Wag the Dog""). Films he wrote and directed never got an award/nomination for directing, but did receive acknowledgement for the writing, such as ""House of Games"", ""The Spanish Prisoner"", and ""Homicide"".In the book, Mamet criticizes actors who bring more to the scene than the simple desire to follow the action. This seems like a strange recommendation for a director who frequently uses such actors as Ricky Jay, J.T. Walsh and Joe Mantagna, although we can see his model actor in people like William Macy and Alec Baldwin whom he also uses repeatedly.It's also interesting to note that Mamet maintains that the best directing is done by juxtaposing visual images which is something we expect from John Ford or Michael Mann, but certainly not from a director whose main trademark is his powerful use of dialogue. Only in his last film, Redbelt, has he displayed his commitment to the visual in the manner that one would expect from this book.Despite the contradictions, the book is interesting to examine Mamet's professed approach to directing circa 1990.

My thoughts therefore are those of a novice in the art of creating moving images, but also those of a lifetime viewer of thousands of movies.  Of all those thousands of movies I would rate a few dozen as truly memorable and moving stories that have stuck with me through the years.Mamet's theory of directing seems to be to let the actors tell a story through action rather than narration or emotion, allowing the audience to more closely identify with the actor (who remains a sort of blank slate) and to allow the audience to construct the story line in their own mind from the actions and clues given mainly by the actors in the film. It's an interesting theory and one I would not have thought of, but sort of ignores the importance of the magnetism of the actor in creating a memorable movie.In Mamet's theory, it seems the actors are only important to the extent they can provide those clues to the story line through acting as unobtrusively and simply as possible. But the great and memorable movies generally have star quality, actors who mesmerize the audience with the force of their personalities, who do the kind of emoting, flirting with the camera, and acting out which creates movie magic for the viewer.  Mamet also gives little importance to locations, special effects, musical score, etc. His main idea is that less is always more.Rudolph Valentino, Gary Cooper, John Garfield, Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable, Marlon Brando, John Wayne, Kirk Douglas, Bette Davis, Humphrey Bogart, Rita Hayworth, Jean Paul Belmondo, Francois Dorleac, Liam Neeson, Mel Gibson, Sandra Bullock all are actors who I suspect would be accused by Mamet of over-acting, of doing more than just presenting action as simply as possible without ""inflecting"" anything more.  But those actors made great stories (and even not so great stories) something more than just a story.I think Mamet's theory of directing as written in this book may be aimed at producing a competent and even engaging story, but not a memorable or great one.",Taken from Mamet's1987 Film Directing Class Lectures,Humor & Entertainment,Visit Amazon's David Mamet Page,On Directing Film,16771.0,hardcover,4.2

Taken together, the three geometric elements (or is it four, to lapse into a Pynchonian mindset, or is that progress into...) form a muted horn, and is the symbol for Tristero, the alternate mail system that has been in competition, for centuries, with the establishment systems of Thurn and Taxis, of the Holy Roman Empire, through Wells Fargo, and the U. S. Postal system.This is Thomas Pynchon's second novel, written in 1966. It is a thin work, perhaps a ""pot-boiler"" to keep him going, written between his first, and my favorite work, ""V,"" in 1963, and his magnum opus, ""Gravity's Rainbow,"" written in 1973. I've read them all, each not that long after publication, and decided it is time to re-visit them. Not even 150 pages, it is immensely rich, in the Pynchon style, combining obscure historical events, unlikely chance happenings, fragments of scientific history/theories, sexual romps, puns and song lyrics, always the more than a hint of ""the orbiting ecstasy of true paranoia,"" the fear of the other, the teasing of conspiracy theories, and a character in quest of the truth(s). It is his most ""accessible work,"" and therefore recommended to the first-time Pynchon reader.The central character is Oedipa Maas, who had once been a mistress of the immensely rich Pierce Inverarity, and now has been named as executor of his estate. In the process, she repeatedly encounters signs and clues to the Tristero Empire. But is it all an elaborate hoax, she wonders, towards the end of the book? Pynchon is brilliant, and weaves actual historical events, and his complete fabrications, seamlessly. Where does the reality end, and the fantasy begin?  For example, he includes the real events of submarines trying to circumvent the steel curtain dropped in the Dardanelles during World War I with the fictional account of a fight between Confederate boats and the Russian navy during the American Civil War, which gave rise to the Peter Pinguid Society, a spoof on the John Birch Society. He weaves ""Maxwell's Demon"" into his novel, like perhaps no one else has; the hypothetical intellectual construction of James Clerk Maxwell, the physicist who formulated the laws of Thermodynamics. Caprice and whimsy are a constant in a Pynchon novel, a Plank's constant if you will, consider: ""If miracles were....intrusions into this world from another, a kiss of cosmic pool balls...""  Later he draws parallels between the DT's of an alcoholic, and the dt's of calculus. He postulates that the entire French revolution may have been caused by the Tristero, so that it could issue the Proclamation of the 9th Frimaire, An III, ratifying the end of the Thurn and Taxis postal monopoly in France and the Lowlands.Amidst such caprice, he embeds some wonderful zingers. Concerning a possible postal misprint from the US government, Maas's lawyer, Metzger says: ""So they make misprints...let them. As long as they're careful about not pressing the wrong button, you know?"" Or on the true need for the Tristero: ""...onto a network by which X number of Americans are truly communicating whilst reserving their lies, recitations of routine, arid betrayals of spiritual poverty, for the official government delivery system...""The second time around, and the years of accumulated knowledge, plus Google, make Pynchon even more enjoyable, though the speculation of how much you ""get"" the author is still probably no higher than an 80%.  Most readers seem to either love or hate him; I understand the demurs of the later, but I am clearly in the former.Meanwhile, Maas hopes for one more clue as she awaits the crying of lot 49; although not Pynchon's best, it still deserves the full 5-stars.","A circle, a triangle and a trapezoid...",Humor & Entertainment,Visit Amazon's Thomas Pynchon Page,The Crying of Lot 49 (Perennial Fiction Library),23390.0,hardcover,3.0

This is opposed to the year 1966, when an unnamed critic from this same magazine, in reference to this same book, lamented, ""What is the meaning of the gibberish literature that is currently being published as fast as it can be gibbered?""  I mention these things for two reasons: Mainly because I found the snarky commentary by Time's unknown reviewer to be funnier than anything I read in 'The Crying of Lot 49', but also because I suspect that the opinion on this book still ranges between classic and gibberish.Despite its intricate wordplay and oddball narrative - characteristics that certainly have their charms - there are several reasons why I didn't connect with 'Lot 49'.  The primary one is that Mr. Pynchon's writing comes across as very self-satisfied.  I could probably study 'Lot 49' for a long time, and find something new years from now, but I just couldn't muster much interest in the clues he left during my first reading.  I found myself racing to the end of this short book, on past the standard post-modern ambiguous ending, and glad to move on to something else.Oedipa Maas, housewife, is asked to serve as executrix for the estate of her former lover, the mutli-millionaire Pierce Inverarity.  As she delves deeper into the labyrinth of Pierce's holdings, she discovers (maybe) a strange conspiracy concerning an ages old postal feud, one that, once noticed, seems to stretch into every facet of life.  Aside from some rather dated commentary on the lifestyles of the mid-sixties, the book's main thrust appears to be not so much the mystery that Oedipa uncovers, but the existential effect it has on her.I feel like much of 'The Crying of Lot 49' is cleverness for cleverness' sake (like the names Oedipa Maas and Pierce Inverarity, for example).  In this way it reminds me of David Foster Wallace's fiction - original, skillful, but ultimately unsatisfying.  (I suppose I should say that Wallace reminds me of Pynchon, since Pynchon came first - but I was already familiar with DFW).  Actually, I've come to realize that I feel this way about most post-modern lit, and certainly about 'Lot 49' - that it lacks substance (my disclaimer here is that I often feel like these books would have held a lot more appeal for me when I was a younger man).  It's as if the author, highly educated and incredible facile as a writer is at a loss for something pertinent to say, and, in order to avoid churning out a morality play, instead turns to self-absorbed tales of highly educated and incredibly facile characters who are at a loss for something pertinent in their lives.  This sort of writing would naturally appeal to highly educated, incredibly facile people - especially those who feel they're still missing something from life.  But while they may identify with the situation, I don't think they'll find any balm for their misery except company.",Cleverly conceals that it offers little other than its own cleverness,Humor & Entertainment,Visit Amazon's Thomas Pynchon Page,The Crying of Lot 49 (Perennial Fiction Library),23390.0,hardcover,3.0

I recognized the satire of contemporary Amercian culture, and saw Oedipa as an example of an American Every(wo)man caught up in the blaring, glaring expansion of America as a function of industrialism and capitalism. Oedipa did not seem a full on individual to me, and I think it was on purpose. She finds herself ghosting her way through the landscape of California in a manner only slightly more surreal than the way she ghosted her way to the moment in her life when she came home from the Tupperware Party to find out she was the will's executor. That being said, her involvement in the Trystero mystery that may or may not be a worldwide conspiracy rings almost like a post-modern trip into a psychotic break. You would think, all these things considered, the book would be far more compelling than it is.And, for me, it was not compelling at all, except for two passages that never get revisited. When Oedipa reflects on Mucho's horror at working at the car lot and when she wanders the streets finding the lost people of the town, finding the muted horn symbol everywhere she goes. Both scenes are powerful in language, imagery and are ripe with meaning, but they are quickly over and never revisited. Say what you will about a writer using an economy of words to get his point across, but while Pynchon does this in these two passages well, he seems to go on an on about things that are less compelling and, seemingly, less important. As an example, I know there had to be a reason for the whole mess on the island, but for the life of me I just never cared.I am left wondering if the book is a statement about our need to communicate and our need for privacy and freedom being at odds or if I am off the mark. Then there is an existential aspect as Oedipa is left, one by one, by all the men she meets in her life. She is, in the end, left entirely alone to figure it all out for herself. That's really all I took from the book, that an awesome title that is not explained until the end and wonderfully so. I did love the way the book ended, leaving it up to the reader to decide what he or she makes of the whole thing.For such a short book, it took a long time to read.

Pynchon is going to spend the rest of CoL dissecting, attacking and critiquing the subtext. Note: this says nothing about your abilities as a reader or a person. It says more about CoL 49 than anything. I'd agree with many of the other reviewers that state CoL 49 didn't age well. I'd say that for casual readers under certain ages it's going to be a slog and pretty unfulfilling. I'd even go further and say that for most casual readers, CoL 49's mood will totally escape them.

But, for those out there that can apply the contextual relevance of the times against the backdrop of the blossoming atomic age with all it's promise, horrors, alienation and divisions then CoL 49 is most certainly worth a read. View this work with the kaleidoscopic necessity similar to that of Dr. Strangelove and you'll quickly decode much of what Pynchon is doing.

Needless to say, they were not; many writers who came before Bukowski wrote about the same subjects, with the same level of honesty but a much deeper understanding of human nature.I guarantee you that Aristophanes, for example, partied a lot harder than Bukowski, and understood a lot more about women. Shakespeare, too, often wrote about sex with a very ""modern"" twinkle in his eye. Both of those guys absolutely bury Bukowski - whose only ""advantages"" are a modern setting and childishly simple, easy-to-grasp prose that's only half a step above ""see Jane run."" Anyway, there are plenty of superior 20th century writers, too; John Fante tackled similar subjects but could actually write, and let's not even attempt to compare Bukowski with a clever satirist like John Kennedy Toole...Oddly enough, I think that Bukowski - for all his reputation as a party animal - comes across as a weak and antisocial personality in this (semi?) autobiographical book (he wittily renames himself ""Chinaski""). His relationships with women, as chronicled here, are all superficial and boring, and sometimes even gross; e.g., a favorite activity of one of his girlfriends is to pop the zits on his back. I kid you not. He has repetitive arguments with these women, which go nowhere, and reveal nothing but the vicious selfishness and stupidity of all concerned. Nothing is ever illuminated, and there are no ""lessons"" here for anyone who has lived through even one disaster of a relationship.In short, there is no reason to read this if you've ""been there, done that"" (and who hasn't?) The last time I tried to soldier through the book, I got so disgusted that I abandoned my copy in a bar, where it has no doubt acquired a coating of filth, peanut shells and sticky beer.

The mail art project gathers anonymous postcards confessing a broad range of secrets and here are put together  loosely around the cycle of life, from childhood to old age.While most of the material is generally entertaining, there is a bit of a repetitive feel-good factor, and a pretentious vibe that feels a bit boring and somewhat predictable as one turns the pages. It is not necessarily that Warren's work has turned consciously deceiving but the process itself, if it ever was that spontaneous, feels a bit trite and fake.Postcards are quite elaborate, graphically sophisticated for the most part, and quite a few of the ""secrets"" aim to be domestically shocking, or personally disturbing, with some peppered mundane remarks, which are perhaps the most interesting as a social documentation. But after so many, it might be fair to ask to what extent senders were crafting a product that they knew was having quite a media exposure and if noticed enough would have a chance to appear in book form.Now, that artifice could also be interesting, but the volume does not dare to go there and seems to take, and offer, the postcards at face value, which at best is lazy and at worst manipulative. Peppered throughout are some interesting notes from Warren about how the project has developed, its feel-good factor and community outreach aspect. At this point that depth feels a bit shallow, although it makes for a mildly entertaining coffee-book.","Another iteration of PostSecret: insightful, entertaining and maybe a bit dishonest.",Humor & Entertainment,Visit Amazon's Frank Warren Page,A Lifetime of Secrets: A PostSecret Book,25087.0,hardcover,4.67

The book takes place in the future, where mankind lives in the ""perfect"" society of OneState.  No one has names, everyone is a ""Number"".  All of the buildings, including furniture are made of transparent glass, the better for the Guardians to keep an eye on everyone.  Everything is regulated, from the work day, to meals (food is made from petroleum) to sexual relations (which require a pink ticket).  Every Number has a shaven head and wears a uniform with a badge that contains a clock.  Any dissent is punishable by death, meted out by the Benefactor, the ruler of OneState.The story is told by D-503, a mathematician and engineer, who is building the Integral, a spacecraft designed for the sole purpose of taking OneState's message and control to whatever alien lifeforms might exist.  D-503 is happy and content to live and serve in OneState, at least until he meets I-330, a mysterious woman who's part of an underground movement seeking to overthrow OneState's oppressive government.  As the story progresses, D-503 finds himself questioning himself and his beliefs as he becomes more deeply involved with I-330.The book is written as a series of D-503's journal entries and the writing style Zamyatin employs serves to reinforce that construct.  In this halting, almost primitive style, the reader is presented with D-503's moral dilemmas, his fear, his burgeoning love, and spark of individuality against the backdrop of enforced conformity.  There's a feeling of claustrophobia that permeates this novel, which far outweighs any of the hokier science-fiction elements of the story.  Not as sharp as 1984 orBrave New World, but well worth a read.","A Bleak, Claustrophobic Vision of the Future",Humor & Entertainment,Visit Amazon's Yevgeny Zamyatin Page,We,25682.0,hardcover,3.25

I know: they are all small issues, but it is unacceptable to pay this price for something with such problems.Amazon really should take a little bit more care with its Kindle products (I know that the problem probably occurred by the publisher, while converting the original text).I would rate 4 stars if there was no problems with the kindle edition.

It takes place in the 26th century, where he shows us the end result of progressivism - given enough power and enough time. He shows us how the humans in a progressive dystopian future will be absolutely certain that they are living in a perfect utopia.Now I know what you're thinking, but We is refreshingly lighthearted and even goofy, which is appropriate given the naivety of the main character and his people, who have never been exposed to a dangerous idea, and who have never had to make a tough decision.We learn all about our future ""utopia"" through a few months in the life of the main character, who is simply documenting his day-to-day observations for the benefit of humans elsewhere in the solar system. You see, outside of Earth, humans have yet to understand how absolute conformity benefits everyone absolutely.During this period in the life of the main character, he meets a woman who risks everything to introduce him to ideas and emotions he has never known before. He documents his daily flip flops between his loyalty to her and his loyalty to his government.The main character is not just anyone in his utopian world. He is the architect of the ship that will carry the philosophy of earth to all humans so that maybe the ship won't have to convert them through force. This ship is being built as the novel progresses.Is the new woman in his life just using him because he is the architect and future captain of the ship? Does she really love him? We suspect that like Mata Hari, the answer is both.The main character is immature and weak - of course. He makes many right decisions and many wrong decisions. We never know until the last page whether he will develop the strength of character to make decisions that will ultimately lead to an era of renewed freedom, or to the permanent enslavement of all humanity.Although Zamyatin was a Bolshevik, he was disturbed by the willingness of other Bolsheviks to censor artists and writers. Given just a few early indications, before Stalin, he correctly foresaw many of the atrocities of Stalinism, and we can see how many more of his prophecies would come true in the future if progressivism were given enough power and enough time.We was a direct influence of the novel 1984, and was an indirect influence on the novel Brave New World. Excellent movies that seem indirectly based on We are Brazil and Equilibrium. These are all quite intense, so afterwards, I recommend Idiocracy.We is deceptively lighthearted. It will leave you disturbed for a very long time.In We, I have a discovered a novel that beautifully illustrates my own recent epiphany (at EndOfInnocence): Given enough power and time, the result of Progressivism will have been to kill the soul of humanity.",Progressivism Would Kill the Soul of Humanity,Humor & Entertainment,Visit Amazon's Yevgeny Zamyatin Page,We,25682.0,hardcover,3.25

Blankenship,5.0,2009,"With well over 200 review of this book, there certainly is not much left to say; as the good, the bad and the ugly have already been pretty well hashed out, as has the plot. I am a rather new reader of Pratchett so I certainly am in no position to comment as to if this is his best work or not. I will say though, that if this is not as good as his future works, then I am in for a pure reading treat down the road as I work myself through future books, as I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Anyway, I am certainly not going to beat the plot to death in this review. There are many fine reviews found here that do that already.This, so I am told, is the first of the Disc World Series. Disc World is quite an unlikely place, yet if viewed through the eyes of the author, it is all around us. I suppose there are some basic requirements for reading and enjoying Pratchett. It would seem that you must possess a rather quirky outlook on life, have a vivid imagination and must scramble those two traits with a rather caustic sense of humor. I also feel that these books cannot be fully appreciated if the reader dose not have the ability to laugh at his or her self. After all, if you want to be very honest about it, most of the characters we meet have large portions of our own personalities and defects in them. I personally found, when I was dead honest with myself, a lot of shared characteristic with Twoflower, and indeed, even Luggage. I really don't feel these books are for everyone, but for those that like this sort of thing, it simply does not get any better. I do feel you have to have a large reading data or knowledge base to fully enjoy these books as the author does almost constantly make reference, in very sneaky ways at times, to other works of literature and fiction. If you do not know what he is poking fun at, you loose something in the humor department.The writing style of this author and his imagination are beyond question as to quality and quantity. This is a very readable book and Pratchett is a naturally story teller.Now I have to admit to having cheated a bit and have read a couple of the books from later in the Disc World Series. This book does set things up nicely for those books, in particular in introducing characters such as Death. There are concepts that the author throws around that I will not even pretend to understand, but that is part of the magic and delight of these books. This offering is no different!All in all, this is a wonderful read and I cannot wait for more.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",A MAGICAL READ,Humor & Entertainment,Visit Amazon's Terry Pratchett Page,The Color of Magic: A Discworld Novel,27872.0,hardcover,4.0

As a satire of the fantasy genre, the book has no boundaries and succeeds and fails for it.  The author takes aim at a number of cliches and stereotypes and succeeds about 66% of the time.  However, the author seemed to want to skewer so many different cliches that the narrative connecting them suffers.  It reminds me of a movie parody a la Scary Movie.  Whether the movie/book works depends on how skillfully the disparate scenes are connected.  Here, the connections are hit and miss.At times, it seems like the author paints himself into a corner and just makes up some ridiculous to solve the problem.  For instance, at one part of the book, the two main characters are falling to certain death from several thousand feet in the air.  All of sudden - Whoosh - and they are on an airplane on an alternate world for a page or two and then - Whoosh - they are back in their own world miles away and several thousand feet over water.  In the next paragraph, they are washing up on an island.  It makes the reader go Wait, What, how did they survive the fall?

Yet even though conclusions hold the higher place, the start of something still elicits a certain fascination -- especially when it comes to a multi-volume genre series. At least it did for me when I sat down with The Color of Magic, Terry Pratchett's first entry in the inimitable Discworld books. Sure, I knew later installments had a reputation as something special, but how much of that uniqueness translated to the series' earliest iteration?Even the least judgmental individual on Discworld (the dinnerplate-shaped planet carried through the vastness of space on the backs of four cosmic elephants who are, in their turn, borne by a turtle of star-swallowing size named the Great A'Tuin) would have to confess that Rincewind is a complete failure as a wizard. Booted out of Unseen University after sneaking a peek at a forbidden book, he exhibits not only perpetual cowardice, but also an inability to remember any spells. That is, of course, because the page he glanced at in the forbidden book happened to contain one of the eight basic spells comprising the fabric of reality itself, and it burrowed into his mind the moment he saw it. The mass of all that arcane knowledge simply crowds all other magic out of Rincewind's skull. So he contents himself by whiling away his days with drink in the Broken Drum, one of Ankh-Morpork's seedier pubs. At least he did until Twofeather the tourist came strolling into the establishment, scattering gold coins as though they'd gone out of style and looking for a guide. Seems Twofeather comes from the Counterweight Continent, a land so wealthy that many regard it as mythical. And Rincewind, well, he'd be a fool to ignore all that gold, wouldn't he? So one might think, except that pair will end up on a perilous tour indeed, one that takes them to the eldritch temple of a soul-munching demigod, the lands of bickering dragonriders who soar on semi-imaginary lizards, and the Rim of Discworld where the seas froth over the flat planet's edge into the endless void.Although I had only a rough exposure to Discworld prior to reading Color, I knew enough to recognize it contained most of the series' trademarks. Baroque fantasy settings, nudge-and-a-wink satire of real-world subjects, ludicrous absurdism and over-the-top silliness -- all make appearances. Only they feel really rough. Though the action is fun, Pratchett resorted to (often literal) deus ex machina resolutions an awful lot, and Color ends with the second-worst cliffhanger I've ever read. Additionally, when the most noble and sympathetic character turns out to be a magical piece of luggage with an indomitable desire to follow its owner and a taste for the appendages of any who would harm him, you know the author has a likeability problem on his hands.

We must have a good grasp of fundamental principles concerning visual structure.The Visual Story by Bruce Block reads a lot like a textbook. Since I prefer a book to come across as if hearing some guru on the subject teach me, this is a con. That being said, it is an excellent textbook. In the early chapters it sets stages for fundamentals like Contrast/Affinity and Space for example. Then, throughout the book it constantly refers to these pillars of visual design giving real world examples.Which brings me to my next point, the examples this book gives are superb. Bruce Block will cover a subject, like TONE, for an entire chapter and at the end he will bring the lesson full circle by giving you `films to watch.' But wait! The films that Bruce recommends vary extensively! In the TONE chapter, `films to watch' include the movies T-Men (1947) and Kill Bill (2003) [plus a handful more]. Using this layout, Bruce is able to convey that the subject matter for each chapter is TIMELESS! His example movies transcend not only time released, but also subject matter and themes.This book really shines with its illustrations.

The Man can be interpreted as those in power - CEOs, police higher-ups, real estate tycoons, etc.  Note that the exact phrase The Man does not appear anywhere in this book, as far as I can remember.  But that phrase seems to be the easiest for me to make my points.In this novel, which I think is Pynchon's easiest to follow (I've read Vineland, Gravity's Rainbow, The Crying of Lot 49, a little bit of V, and am starting Mason & Dixon), the overall theme I'm seeing is that The Man wants to keep things under control, and the Manson murders have spooked them (this takes place around 1970 in Southern California).  There's also the remembrance of the Watts Riots as additional support for The Man's worry.  The novel's main character, Doc Sportello, represents a free-spirit wannabe that is certainly unhappy with The Man.  Most every possible case of lower-class revolution (even if just in thought only) is addressed and stifled by The Man.  I think that Pynchon's views, and even more of himself, are represented by Doc and sometimes argued out loud, with passion.  It seems to me that past Pynchon protagonists have not felt as passionately about their viewpoint.  But Doc does realize that those that support his viewpoint are either without power to make changes, or they simply don't have the energy to try.  So, he's realistic, but nonetheless passionate.Somehow, I think of the novel's voice as being illustrated by the movie Billy Jack (also not referenced in the book).  It's that scene where Billy is surrounded by a bunch of thugs and he's told ""You don't think those Green Beret karate tricks are going to save you from all these boys, do you?""  To which he replies ""I don't have much of a choice, do I?  But, you know what, I'm going to take this right foot here and wop you on that side of the face.""  Billy knows he's beat, but he's going to get some hard shots in.In the end, I felt satisfied that the loose ends were, in fact, tied up - at least to my satisfaction.  The final pages give a perfect sense for how I felt by the end of the novel.I really liked this book, and maybe loved it.  I liked the Doc character and pretty much agreed with his politics.  Additionally, I felt for Doc.As with any Pynchon novel, there are a lot of peripheral characters, and back stories.  Doc is the only fully fleshed-out character, but the novel is also from his viewpoint.  Thus, he explains only what he knows and so you get his understanding of the other characters.  I suppose a certain detective gets explained in some detail, but once again only from Doc's viewpoint.Overall, I'd put this book on par with Vineland and The Crying of Lot 49.  However, to me it ends with more certainty than either of those books.  In fact, you can say that the three of those books form a segment of time from the 1960's to the 1980's - so they make perfect companions to each other.After just finishing some book about a vampire private investigator, this one was so much more satisfying.","Accessible Pynchon, but still Pynchon",Humor & Entertainment,Visit Amazon's Thomas Pynchon Page,Inherent Vice: A Novel,38719.0,hardcover,3.0

His method of doing this is called Self Actualization.  There are several steps to self actualization, but they are all rather simple ones, such as listening to your own taste, letting your true sense emerge and choosing between the safety of the known path and taking a risk.This is a short essay-type publication, but one that can be read over a few times in order to absorb all of its messages.  Some of the steps in the process of self actualization could be explained in more detail, but most are simple in concept.  The author begins by saying that we get fleeting happiness from goods and services but it doesn't last.  It is a result of our global consumer society.  Creating the right conditions for ourselves leads to inner happiness and that kind lasts. Accepting people for exactly who they are is also another step along the way.I enjoyed reading this and plan to read it again.  It isn't anything purely outstanding, but it is written simply and from the heart of the author.

It is unlikely that anyone will finish this book and suddenly be completely Self-Actualized.  Instead they will have some ideas that they can apply to their lives and will hopefully be inspired to take an honest look at themselves - who they are and what they truly want - which should eventually lead to a more lasting experience of happiness.Overall, this is a very well-written book, and I am glad to have read it.","This is a well-written, short book on Self-Actualization","Health, Fitness & Dieting",David Tuffley, Being Happy,29271.0,kindle,3.33

Athletes at all levels could benefit from the advice and the author knows how to tell a good story.That said, some of the stories were either redundant or kind of a stretch. Like the one about the air hostess muttering &#34;I love my job, I love my job&#34; under her breath to stay calm while being harassed by one of the team's the author worked for during a post-game flight.I don't see how this is a really good example of staying positive. It seems more of an example of the author failing to intervene while a bunch of rowdy men were repeatedly rude to a woman in a service job and called into question the author's judgment. Another story about staying calm while being fired was much more applicable and we didn't need this second story to illustrate the same point.I think anyone who is just beginning a sport will benefit the most from this book.

Eat food, not weird food-like substances, the less packaging the better, the more plants the better, and if there's a place on it to write how good for you it is, it probably isn't.It's when the author gives examples he makes me impatient. He advises we eat like our great grandmothers did. Well, maybe in his family they could afford green things shipped from heaven-knows-where all year round, but my great grands didn't eat anything green from October til the next June, because we live in Northern New York. Maybe you could count pickles. No, let's not.Has Pollan ever heard of scurvy? rickets? Pellagra? Those diseases are from the way our great grandparents ate.  Pollan also has a real affection for tofu and other processed bean products, breathlessly inserted in the same book as the phrases saying we should avoid processed foods. Most of my ancestors didn't eat a lot of bean curd--probably his wealthy anscestors could afford it and travelled more than mine--but also I am genuinely puzzed: anything wrong with eating real beans?Pollan also doesn't like ""spinach artichoke dip"" or ""ranch dressing."" I'm with him, I KNOW they are not nutrition. But if the dip is the gateway to getting my child to declare she likes spinach, I'll take it. (It has worked just fine for that purpose. She eats spinach voluntarily after the trying spinach artichoke dip. Maybe his child was more cooperative with good food.) Same with ranch dressing--if it gets my children to eat the vegetables, sooner or later they'll eat them on their own.I'd like to have seen more documentation on the low-fat milk and the processed meat, more real studies.I like the book. I'd just like it better with fewer personal elitist examples, and more science. I'm sure he doesn't mean to be snobby.

This one is no exception, but as the title of this review suggests, I wasn't quite as sold on this book as Omnivore's Dilemma. Pollan is at his best when he does his investigative journalist thing; when, in the last third of this book, he starts getting into ""food rules"" (which he admits is an odd thing for a journalist to be doing), problems ensue.His suggestions for how to eat are written to sound sensible and practical, but they really aren't for a great many people. He spends a lot of time criticizing the way Americans don't eat for pleasure the way the French do (a legitimate critique, certainly), yet he fails to acknowledge that for many Americans, eating McDonald's and Twinkies IS pleasurable eating. How are you going to convince people who have grown up thinking of fast food as delicious food that they should eat mostly plants? How are you going to make someone agree that broccoli can be just as yummy as a Big Mac? The reason we have fat-free cookies is so that we can supposedly get the best of both worlds: ""health"" (which, as Pollan notes, is a lie) and ""tastiness.""  Pollan might not think Snackwell cookies are tasty (I don't either), but a whole lot of people do.I get the feeling this book and the ""Food Rules"" book were the result of pressure from Pollan's publisher for him to write a couple of cash cows (no pun intended) based on how many readers were clamoring for a clear guide on what they should eat to be healthy. This goes against everything Pollan establishes in all of his works: the way to be healthy is to stop obsessing about being healthy.

It is easily in my top five favorite books of all time.  Why?First, it challenges three very prevalent but ultimately false beliefs in our culture: that the mind is a blank slate,that any period in the past is more peaceful than our own, and the intuitive notion that humans have a spirit separate from their body.  However, the demolition of these ideas merely occupies the first 100 pages of, as Pinker books typically are, a lengthy read of 500 pages.  The rest of the book discusses the implications of these ideas being false, and they are more far reaching than I could have possibly imagined going into the book.I really can't sing the praises of this book enough.  Pinker discusses the political implications of the innate human nature, and what it means humans can and can't do.  For example, we cannot make humans fully altruistic, or make people genetically predisposed to certain behaviors behave radically differently.  Pinker notes that parenting, for instance, does much less to affect a child's behavior than most suspect.  He also discusses interesting research about the limitations of human choice.  For example, split brain patients (those with a severed corpus callosum, the nerves connecting the right and left hemisphere of our brain) demonstrate that humans, rather than choosing what to do, as those who believe in free will would suggest, instead just do things and then generate a story to their behavior.  For instance, one half of their brain would be shown the command to get up and walk, but when asked why they are doing this, the other half of their brain would generate an explanation ""to get a soda.""Meh, what am I trying to do?

It's important because it shows that American intellectual and political life is based on ideas that have no basis in fact. Like it or not, the holy trinity of the &#34;Blank Slate&#34;, the &#34;Noble Savage&#34;, and the &#34;Ghost in the Machine&#34; dominate (usually without question) public life in America. The fact that they are fictions, inevitably means that politicians (typically, but not always Democrats) promote policies that will inevitably fail. Of course, the failures will be ignored because no one ever dares to ask why the policies failed.The first two ideas (the &#34;Blank Slate&#34; and the &#34;Noble Savage&#34;) are mainly the follies of the left. Indeed, any attack on them is treated as religious apostasy (and punished without mercy). The third idea (the &#34;Ghost in the Machine&#34;) is perhaps more the passion of the right.Before I read this book, I expected a detailed review of the data supporting the influence of genes vs. the environment. Of course, Steven Pinker provides a great wealth of data demolishing the ideological fantasies of the left (and to some extent the right). However, that's not the main emphasis of the book. The book is mostly devoted to a very detailed exploration of moral philosophy. That's not a critique, just quite unexpected.Rather than delving into the factual data demolishing the holy trinity in great(er) detail, the author expends most of his effort into examining the moral and philosophical implications of human nature. Pinker is always plausible, but not always convincing, at least to this reader.Steven Pinker is clearly a conventional liberal, at least in moral, philosophical, and policy terms. However, his book is deeply subversive of conventional liberalism (at point Pinker is clearly well aware of). At some level that makes Pinker's interpretation of the world conservative. Pinker (to his credit) examines the deep historical origins of liberalism and conservatism. To simplify, liberals believe in the infinite perfectibility of man and conservatives believe that man in constrained by his tragic nature.Having reviewed the voluminous evidence, Pinker explicitly says that the conservative vision of human nature is correct and liberals are wrong. He even quotes E.O. Wilson&#8220;Karl Marx was right, socialism works, it is just that he had the wrong species&#8221;That said, Pinker is no Republican and there is no reason to think he has ever voted for one.

What makes them believe that women, children, casual passerby's should be killed along with themselves?

I don't know if he had been in any fights, but the working conditions along the wharfs in the '40's and 50's were a bit more primitive than they are today.

I read this book and found it to be absorbing and yet disturbing. My youth is chronicled here from my early embrace of Communism, the prolife movement and my present life as a Christian.Hoffer's contention is that the incomplete ego finds its completion in a mass movement. The weak self finds completion in anonymity and a common cause- freed from being ""condemned to being free."" Hoffer focuses this book on Communism, Christianity and Fascism- from St. Paul to the collapse of feudalism in Japan and Russia and then Hitler.Hoffer's Highway crosses some interesting countryside. Quite a fast highway trip through time. The mass movement armed with its army of true believers becomes a compelling motive force in history, yet the damage they cause is ignored by Hoffer.Hoffer never discusses whether the ""True Believer"" is actually a follower because what he believes in is at least a partial truth. A partial truth that the believer finds succour in. A truth that is true. The merits of Communism are left alone...not worthy of discussion. Can we believe that class struggle is at least a partial motive force in history while simultaneously believing that the Marxist theory of native Communism is baseless?The remarkable conversion of Paul is simply the result of a weak ego seeking completion rather than the result of a traumatic event according to Hoffer. Hoffer frequently quotes Bible verses as authority to prove his points and we are left to wonder how the conversion of Paul can really fit into Hoffer's mass movement theory.Paul, an allegedly weak ego seeking completion, joins a small, despised movement after leaving a position of power and status as a jewish prosecutor really makes little sense unless a intervening event occurred that radically changed his worldview or perhaps made Paul mentally ill. If Paul was a loon then his subsequent missionary life would not have been possible. Paul shook the Roman Empire to its foundations after travelling over most of it and planting new churches in the bowels of paganism...only to be martyred for a cause he clung to because of a weak ego!It would be as if Senator Joe McCarthy ""Tail Gunner Joe"" grew tired of his Communist baiting, with its dubious fame, and left his federal position to become a Communist tract distributor on a lonely street corner in a period of a few days! The joining of a defective ego into a mass movement is described as ""assimilation"" by Hoffer. Why would a defective ego leave a position of power to be assimilated as an outcast?The book is riddled with assumptions and dubious history. Christianity was not spread by state power contrary to Hoffer's claim. Rome had lions that knew better. The reader is advised to read any of Peter Bamm's secular history of the New Testament or the book ""From Christ to Constantine"". ""Fox's Book of Martyrs"" tells us that the state persecution of Christians even went on after the Roman Empire became Christian.Contrary to what this book tells us Judaism was not resistant to the early church. Archaeological evidence from Qumran shows Christianity, Judaism, and the early Essenes closely interconnected as detailed in ""The Earliest Gospel Manuscript?"" by Carsten Peter Thiede.The early church arose in a cultural network not as an isolated cult. The ample evidence from the Roman catacombs needs no explanation to show that Jews and Christians were cultural brothers in a pagan sea. The Bible, again quoted by Hoffer, makes numerous references to the cultural influence on the early church by Jews- how was this possible without interaction between Christians and Jews?Similar to the discussion of Christianity, Socialism gets short billing and a too quick overview. We are told that men are ""universal cowards"" but not fools and that characteristic allows brutal regimes to last (p 110). The last I heard Hoxha's Albania is no longer around despite being horrific right to the end and never affected by Communist reform ""de stalinization"".Hoffer tells us that Hitler could trump Socialism because he promised direction and control that the socialist Wiemar Republic could not command. Hoffer echoes George Orwell on this point... that democratic socialism offered only comfort and not the promise of heroics and therefore could not compete with the demagogues (p 114). Fascist theory is left in its own dark corner, thankfully. Why would ""universal cowards"" overthrow a tyrant in Albania or join the Nazis with their promise of dark heroics? Hoffer contradicts himself on this point. It is more reasonable to say that men are optimizers who react to circumstances as they change.What are the historic facts of the NAZI birth? Hitler nearly lost his last election to the Left, the socialist SPD, the Communist KPD, and had to ally himself with the National Party in Germany to gain power...the old landed reactionaries allied with NAZI SA brown shirts against the growing ""Red Menace.""The Nazi war machine was a welfare state as many old Germans attest ""my father had a job"". Here in Germany I see Nazi autobahns, public housing ""NS-wohninkomplex"", maternity pensions and the boundless legacy of Dr. Ley's work organization all over Europe...occupied Europe built by slave and paid workers from North Africa and the occupied nations. Men who worked for the rational cause of money.The Nazi state was a welfare state for Germany and a Europe wracked by economic chaos.  Thankfully, the Nazi defeat brought a new order to Europe marked by the post war welfare state. The Germans who needed the NAZI movement to be ""free from freedom,""as Hoffer states, chose democratic socialism, the SPD, after the war as they almost chose it before Hitler and then accepted NAZI war socialism after Hitler's takeover.""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"", a good historical reference supports my contentions.A rational choice towards security rather than the annihilation of the self controls mass movements as it did with Nazism.Here in Germany the Reformation is still topical. Hoffer offers us an interesting flawed view of the early reformers...they were a learned humanist elite ""non clerical humanists"" allied with the power structure. Luther, Knox, Calvin, Hus were ""non clerical humanists?"" Last I heard they were all clerics. These ""humanists"" were influenced by printing presses against a church which looked the other way because it was filled with indifferent toadies (p 123). Hmmm...the Inquistion never happened? Foxe's Book of Martyrs is all fantasy?Hoffer's idea of a national works program for the young echoes the New Deal and would have been interesting as a complete paragraph. A national works program like the New Deal Civilian Conservation Corps(CCC)or Work Projects Administration(WPA)could channel energy away from ideology and instability towards productive work.

Benson,4.0,2009,"Body by Science has some great chapters on somatypes, insulin metabolism, aerobic and cardio myths,fat loss, genetics, epigenetics, romanticizing our ancestors, assuming causal relationships when looking at fit people, and training adaptation. As with any book, it's important to keep checking on updates to the information presented.This book states that omega-6 fats are harmful. Here is some new research from Webmd:[...]WebMD Health NewsReviewed by Louise Chang, MDJan. 26, 2009 -- The American Heart Association (AHA) has come to the defense of omega-6 fatty acids, the fats found in many grains and most vegetable oils that some have linked to heart disease.In a scientific advisory released today, an AHA panel noted that there is little credible evidence that omega-6 fatty acids promote inflammation and increase cardiovascular risk.The experts concluded that reducing omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from their current levels would be more likely to increase the typical American's risk for heart disease than decrease it.""Our goal was simply to let Americans know that foods containing omega-6 fatty acids can be part of a healthy diet, and can even help improve your cardiovascular risk profile,"" researcher and panel chairman William S. Harris, PhD, notes in a news release.""So now I question other claims in the book, since authors usually get their information from others who get their information from an original-but-not-so-credible source, and since it has been repeated so often we often don't question the origin. We just believe it because we are bamboozled by chemical terms and processes that we accept on faith because we cannot ""see"" the microscopic biological processes ourselves.From the Clarence Bass site:""The Washington Post  also reported a little-known aftermath of Wayne Westcott's slow lift studies. ""The bad news,"" Westcott told The Post, ""is that when I finished both studies (of slow lifting vs. standard lifting), only one of the 147 people involved... wanted to continue the training. We feel it's a little too tedious, too tough for the average person.""The written description of how to do correct squats is correct, yet the accompanying photo shows one of the authors doing a squat with rear to heels and heels up with weight on the balls of the feet and knees in front of the toes. I've been taught that this position (in the photo) is harmful to the knees.The authors recommend going to positive failure once a week, preferably on the Nautilus-type machines (which they have at their facilities)  since going to positive failure with free-weights could be dangerous. The exercises they recommend are done on the machines in a sitting position, which is not functional for everyday life, in case that is important to you. Their free-weight version of the seated row is a standing, bent-over row, which puts a lot of leverage on the low back.Even with these problems the book is very good about reducing training anxiety, setting realistic goals, pointing out that sports aren't necessarily healthy, and encourages healthy eating. I recommend reading the articles on Doug McGuff's two websites and watching his online videos.",Nutrition update since book was published...,"Health, Fitness & Dieting",Visit Amazon's John R.

636,42063,42063,252012,A38WWFZV6NQYUN,0071597174,Buba,5.0,2010,"I have been lifting weights for about 2 years on a multiple times per week basis.  I have a home gym with both a Vectra machine and bench and free weights.  I am a victim of Dr. Kenneth Cooper's aerobic revolution of the 70's and 80's, now with bad knees and bad ankles and chronic tendinitis and 2 herniated disks and spinal arthritis, which is what brought me to weight training in the first place.  Over the years I have tried my own program, and I have purchased several programs from the ""Guru's"" and I pretty much always wound up either injured or I would make progress for a while and then it would seem I would start going backward.  My most recent program was the New Rules of Lifting program which I have found to be a very good program.  I've done that for a year and have made progress and remained injury free.  That program is basically a two or three times per week program and I noticed that I needed the rest between sessions to keep improving.  Sometimes I would go down to one session per 5 or 6 days and I found when I lifted next it was easier to make an advance.  That couple extra days allowed a more complete recuperation.  The exercises in the new rules program are basically the big 5 that is described in the Body by Science program, so over the course of the year I have developed good form with each exercise and a good knowledge of how my body feels during the lift and post lifting.When I read this program it seemed to fit well with what I had been doing.  I was of course skeptical of the 12 minute claim as the New Rules program is a timed set of reps across the exercises of about 45 minutes per session.  In the New Rules program if you were anal about the timed aspect you would be forced into an anaerobic state of metabolism which I think is desirable in a workout.  You can tell you've gone anaerobic when you quit lifting and ten minutes later your respiratory rate is still elevated.  Your body at that point is working off the metabolic acid load it accrued during the anaerobic activity and converting it to CO2 and that extra CO2 load is being expelled by your increased resp rate.  I could tell the by the way I felt that was the hormonal changes and increased metabolism associated with micro damage.  I decided to give slo mo pumping as described in Body by Science a whirl.  What it claims is true.  I do 6 exercises bench press, reverse grip pull down, overhead press, seated row, squats and dead lifts, using the time under load method of accounting and trying to maintain 10-15 seconds during reps and it kicks my hind end.  I go deep into anaerobic metabolism as I start huffing like a choo choo.  I can also tell I am going deep into anaerobic metabolism because I get hot and start to sweat, signs of big sympathetic outflow and my heart starts beating like a trip hammer.  I can tell the muscle micro damage and metabolic changes are greater with this slo mo methodology and I find I NEED a week to recover.  I could probably compress that to 5 full days but the difference between 5 full days of rest and a week is not enough to push it.  I'm still getting into the method trying to keep my form perfect during the time under load.I am a physician, so I read with interest the physiology described in the book, and what is described in general is correct.  I'm not sure I would hang my hat on the ""fact"" that we grow big muscles so we can run away from tigers, in fact to me that is an unlikely reason.  If you have to run away from a tiger once a week in order to build big muscles its unlikely you are going to escape from being dinner.  I think it is probably more steeped in a protective adaptation to inflammation response that lifting causes, than running away from tigers.  The cardiovascular information is absolutely true in terms of this kind of training being better than the typical ""cardio"" kind of exercise.  Your heart responds to the demand of your muscles.  The whole reason you have a heart and lungs is to deliver 2mm of Oxygen tension to the mitochondria in your cells to provide for aerobic metabolism and to wisk away CO2 and metabolic byproducts.  When your energy utilization overwhelms your aerobic potential that is when your muscles need more oxygen than your heart and lungs can deliver that is when you get a cardiovascular adaptation.  Aerobic exercise by definition NEVER gets you there precisely because it is aerobic.  If you ain't huffing like a choo choo (the sure sign of anaerobic metabolism) you may as well be sipping a drink by the pool in my opinion.  I also believe every single beneficial claim proposed in terms of anti-hypertension and anti-diabetes improved flexibility and relief from back pain etc etc to be true.  I have a pain management practice and I encourage my patients to do weight training to the extent they can, especially those who have managed to escape surgery.So I think this plan is a worth while plan.  I think if you are not well trained in weights you absolutely MUST have someone who truly knows about weight training train you.  If you go off half cocked in this kind of program eventually you will hurt yourself.  If you have a home gym like I do then I think you should spend 6 months learning how to lift with perfect form using something like the New Rules program before you venture into the Body by Science program.  If you have a trainer he can adjust you during an exercise, but if you don't then you need to take a good while getting to know your own body and lifting with not other expectation than developing perfect form until it become second nature.  Once you get into lifting it will become a long term part of your life so there is no reason to be in a hurry and not learn to do it right.I think the exercises proposed are the exact correct exercises.  I am a big fan of multi-muscle complex exercises like the dead lift as opposed to doing a billion of hammer curls with a dumbbell trying to increase the size of the third head of the triceps (total waste of time)  I have also come to believe based on my experience over the past 2 years you won't see results quickly if you over train.  In other words you need the time for the biochemistry to work and to let the damage you are producing heal.  If you sprain an ankle (a big injury, not a micro injury) it doesn't get better in 2 days in gets better in 3 to 6 weeks.  In other words you need to give your body the real time it takes to heal and that is based on its own physiology, not on some artificial schedule of lifts per week.  If you are an old pro at lifting then before each exercise run over in your mind what perfect form means.  I like to take 5 seconds to read a card I have prepared that forces me to think about the few things that define perfect form for each exercise.  It takes me out of remote control mode and brings my focus back to the task at hand.  Finally for this exercise regimen I have a big clock with a second had sitting right in front of each station, and I keep records so I can watch my progress.As to the diet, I'm less involved.  I like the idea of eating non processed food, but I think a ration of about 1:1:1 of fats, carbs and protein on a calorie adjusted basis is probably easier to maintain.  I think the problem with processed foods is they tend to really concentrate the calories",A different lifting experience,"Health, Fitness & Dieting",Visit Amazon's John R.

Each section focuses on one theme: friends, family, work, etc. The author encourages you to create your own list to work on, so it's perfect for the start of a new year.There is a real *genuine* feel to this book (not preachy), because the author candidly shares her own experiences with the project. We get to know her husband, Jamie, her in-laws, her two young daughters. She shares her personal struggles, admitting, for example, that she has a ""sharp tongue."" And she gives 100% to her new goals , whether it's something as simple as tackling the ""to do"" list or something as complex as writing a novel in 30 days.I also like the emphasis on accountability. Gretchen created charts with her goals and checked in every day. None of her goals went ""out of sight, out of mind."" This helped her curb her snack habit, increase her walking, etc.  Too many of us make resolutions but skip the accountability step.She's also done a lot of research, and in my opinion, she's quoting from some of the best, such as the book ""How to Talk So Your Children Will Listen . . .""  Reading ""The Happiness Project"" is like having lunch with a very wise, very interesting friend who shares a lot of wisdom in a short time, so you don't have to spend hours retracing her path.You need to buy this book to really appreciate how down to earth this wisdom is. (And don't judge the book by her website, which I found too busy and overcomplicated in comparison.) You will want to read Gretchen's Twelve Commandments and write your own. You will want to see what worked---and what didn't. (Laugh yoga wasn't a big hit for the author.) But also, don't worry that the path will be TOO hard. You can start a one-sentence journal. You can follow a one-minute rule: if it takes less than one minute to do something, such as closing a cabinet door, do it. Not everything is a huge change. (In fact, Gretchen's goal was to boost her happiness *without* making huge changes.) But you will find that all the little things add up.Maybe you won't have the money for a personal trainer (I don't), but everyone can start to walk. Everyone can make a new friend (or three). Everyone can start a gratitude journal.It's been a wonderful read---one I will encourage all my friends to pick up. I've already started to follow her lead: first, I cleaned out the closets and, more important, I took the time to make a photo album for my daughter (which I had convinced myself was too big of a task). And Gretchen was right: just looking at the photos reminded me of all the happiness *I already have.*  You won't regret buying this book.",LOVED it!

This book was the first I have read by Robert A. Johnson. His writing flows fairly well and has a conversational tone. Use of jargon is fairly minimal so even if you have just a passing familiarity with Jungian psychology you will have few problems reading and understanding the book.At 118 pages, ""Owning Your Own Shadow"" is a quick read - though you may find yourself laying it aside at times to mull over what you've read. I've read several of Jung's works and have to admit this book was not what I expected - mostly in a good way. After briefly discussing the concept of the Shadow, most of the book covers the ways in which a self-aware individual can explore their Shadow and begin to channel its energy in a positive way in their life. The book is not in a self-help workbook format, more its discussion is intended to impart some insights which will help one explore their own Shadow and recognize its workings in others.There are a few downsides to the book. Though effective, Johnson's sometimes breezy conversational writing can lack focus and at times left me wondering ""where are we going here?"". He also approaches the topic from a heavily Christian (specifically Roman Catholic) viewpoint, which some readers may find annoying. The book was written in 1991 and is thus approaching 20 years old as of this writing, but it seemed to me that it could benefit from broadening its perspective. I'd be very interested in seeing how some of the ideas played out here apply in a non-Western context, though that'd probably be better suited to an academic conference paper.All in all, a very satisfying book. If you have any interest in the Shadow, or have realized that in your life or those around you there have been recurring themes of someone (perhaps inexplicably) acting against what seem to be their best interests, you will find reading ""Owning Your Own Shadow"" a worthwhile read.","A thoughtful and perceptive look at the Jungian ""Shadow""","Health, Fitness & Dieting",Visit Amazon's Robert A.

It is a companion to his other book Eat To Live.In the preface, he lays out the foundation for the recipes: foods to eat every day, foods to avoid, quantities to take and how to prepare or cook those foods. A lot of the emphasis is on green leafy vegetables and beans - and so the recipes do contain a lot of those ingredients. His suggestion is to avoid foods like breads, animal-derived products such as meats and dairy, and of course sugary foods and soda.  Most of the recipes have a base of what he calls G-Bombs - Greens, Beans, Onions, Mushrooms, Berries, Seeds.  He also rates foods based upon their nutritional value per calorie. Finally, he gives recommendations on food shopping, preparation, herbs, organic product, etc.The recipes are of a great variety and interest but quite a few have already been published by Fuhrman. Worrisome for me is that I don't live in a major metropolitan center where a lot of exotic or less common fruits/vegetables/greens are available. I've been unable to find chia seed, hemp or almond milk, kale leaves, and other ingredients.  Some ingredients are only available here in season.  Tortunately there are not a lot of exotic ingredients - the recipes stick to the staples outlined in Furhman's good food index.One big issue for me, and definitely a minus is that several of the recipes call for premade items sold on Furhman's website. His book states that the recipes are available online but I haven't found them so they aren't really freely available as stated in the book. And those products are extremely expensive - which makes this whole book feel like a ponzi scheme disguised as recipes to get you to his website and buy his products.  I would have trusted the book a lot more if the recipe for those 'zests' (which add the important flavoring) and such were in the book as well. If we paid for a book of recipes, why not truly give us all the ingredients needed without having to go to his website and buy a pre made product?In any event, it all read well and I know Eat To Live has been a great solution for so many.  but I think I'll be avoiding his website, which feels just a little too slick with all its upsell pushing.",Mixed Feelings,"Health, Fitness & Dieting",Joel Fuhrman M.D.,"Eat to Live Cookbook: 200 Delicious Nutrient-Rich Recipes for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss, Reversing Disease, and Lifelong Health",9567.0,hardcover,4.0

[Copy edit to correct: 1944]Popular lore has glorified the false flag operation in fiction and movies. Anderson tells the story straight and wants to right the historical record by stripping away any myth or hype.""Operation Griffin"" was anything but a carefully planned mission carried out by a highly trained commando unit. Instead, it was a last-ditch, ill-conceived frenetic tactic pulled off by ill-equipped volunteers that was damned from the start.In addition to correcting history Anderson tells a gripping story of how it must have felt to be a German infiltrator where ""one can only imagine what it was like, moving among the enemy while disguised as one.""You get a sense of being pummeled by the winter weather, the sights and smells war, ""from the black putrid smoke of exhaust and burning rubber to the sour vapors of leaking gasoline."" Added to that was the pungent stink of ""charred and rotting flesh of men, civilians and cows in all their grotesque death poses.""Once they had crossed the enemy lines, the Germans had means to identify themselves to each other. They should wear pink or blue scarves, leave the second button on their American jackets unbuttoned or tap their helmet twice if stopped by a German sentry.If cornered or challenged by Allied forces the imposters were told to improvise with American slang such as ""Go lay an egg"" or ""So's your old man."" If the situation was grim, the infiltrators were advised to pretend to have diarrhea, drop their pants and trot off to nearby bushes.Anderson tells a compelling tale. He corrects the historical record. What I appreciated most is that he does a thorough, well researched job of following the story through to an ill-fated conclusion that for many of the reluctant German soldiers meant execution by an Allied firing squad.",A false flag operation as ill-conceived as it was ill-fated,History,Visit Amazon's Steve Anderson Page, Sitting Ducks (Kindle Single) eBook,434561.0,kindle,4.0
98,7687,7687,32501,A14QJKY3DA19AP,B0056B0P8U,S. Warfield,4.0,2011,"Cecelia Holland's ""Blood on the Tracks"" is a well-researched and well-written historical narrative about the 1877 uprising of railroad workers on the East Coast of the U.S.  It began small but spread to bigger cities when the railroad wanted to cut workers' wages by 10% which would mean an already struggling group of people would have it even worse.  The Pennsylvania RR decided to run their trains with two engines in tandem thereby pulling more cars but needing fewer crew members, and that meant layoffs.Railroad workers began to strike and state militias were called up.  By 1877 most state militias had served their purpose and were fairly ineffective in controlling large crowds of rowdy people.  This is a very interesting story that isn't often told, but had an impact on the railroads on the East coast.  At the time this took place, only twelve years after the end of the Civil War in 1865, a small group of people held a good portion of the wealth, wages were low, millions were unemployed, and some banks had failed.This is an excellent Kindle Single to read since this event isn't found in most of the history books today. I'm familiar with several of the places mentioned, and I've seen what the decline of the railroad, even today, has done to places like Cumberland, MD.

Just try to imagine the struggles involved in opening in bombed-out Baghdad a reliable supply line for food and alcohol.Describing James is to talk about what it means to be an entrepreneur. He's the type of guy whose inclination ""was to figure out what no one else was doing and make that your game."" James had his own sidekick, Ajax, a former Iraqi translator, a chain smoking wiry little fixer who ""knew lots of guys"" and was trusted by almost everyone.The Baghdad Country Club opened its doors in August 2006. A pattern of harassment by military and civilian authorities began in 2007. Finally, Green Zone police along with the FBI descended and raided the establishment.The raid was something even Ajax couldn't fix. Some people connected with the place were given 24 hours to leave the country. We aren't told how long the BCC had remained in business. But you sense it flourished briefly and flared out quickly.James says that inside the BCC within the Green Zone in the heart of Baghdad there was always a siege mentality. People came together to relax and take comfort. For a brief few months, it was the only place where people could shut out the world.The BCC's story is a matter-of-fact account considering the time and place. It presents a view of war from a new angle.

Seneca of course, is a fascinating figure. Gregory Hays once said about Marcus Aurelius that ""not being a tyrant was something he had to work at one day at a time"" and often, Seneca lost that battle. He was the Cardinal Richelieu behind Nero. He sat back and enjoyed the spoils of his student who had clearly lost his way--at least Aristotle didn't profit from Alexander's lust for power. However, there is some interesting evidence put forth in a paper titled - Seneca: The Case of the Opulent Stoic in which Lydia Motto presents that what we know of Seneca's reputation comes almost entirely from a single, less than objective source. And in fact, if we can trust the way in which Seneca faced his forced suicide there was not much difference between practice and philosophy.The book is profoundly insightful, it calls you to action, and it has that 'quit your whining--this is life' attitude that so defines the Roman Stoics. This is by no means an all inclusive list but is Seneca on some important topics:On doing more than consuming:He should be delivering himself of such sayings, not memorizing them. It is disgraceful that a man who is old or in sight of old age should have wisdom deriving solely from his notebook. 'Zeno said this.' And what have you said? 'Cleanthes said that.' What have you said? How much longer are you going to serve under others? Assume authority over yourself and utter something that may be handed down to posterity. Produce something from your own resources.On endurance:Life's no soft affair. It's a long road you've started on: you can't but expect to have slips and knocks and falls, and get tired and openly wish--a lie--for death.On freedom from perturbation:Show me a man who isn't a slave; one who is a slave to sex, another to money, another to ambition; all are slaves to hope or fear. I could show you a man who has been a Consul who is a slave to his 'little old woman', a millionaire who is the slave of a little girl in domestic service. And there is no state of slavery more disgraceful than one which is self-imposed.On quoting what you read:There is no enjoying the possession of anything valuable unless one has someone to share it with. I shall send you, accordingly, the actual books themselves, and to save you a lot of trouble hunting all over the place for passages likely to be of use to you, I shall mark the passages so that you can turn straight away to the words I approve and admire.""","Seneca, the Stoic Saint",History,Visit Amazon's Lucius Annaeus Seneca Page,Letters from a Stoic (Penguin Classics),11907.0,hardcover,4.17
557,30796,30796,299578,A1D4PVZ0QWEAW1,0140442103,greg taylor,3.0,2010,"This will not be a review about Seneca. I suppose I will attempt that one day once I manage to go thru my library's Loeb Classical Library edition of Seneca's Epistles.The purpose of this review is to bellyache about the Penguin Classics' edition of this work. I come not to criticize this translation. I have no Latin. For all I know it is brilliant.What I am here to criticize is the decision to edit Seneca's work all to Tartarus and back. There are 124 Letters in Seneca's Epistles. Campbell gives you 40. Or just over 32%! Campbell's criteria as to which letters to present is a personal one. He evaluated their interest and whether or not they were repetitive. His is admittedly charming in his own defense on this issue. He quotes Roger L'Estrange (another anthologist of Seneca's) from 1673 to the effect that anyone who complains about the selection is an unmannerly guest who eats at his host's table and then critiques the meal. I embrace this description. I may well use The Unmannerly Guest as my nom de plume for my reviews from now on.Here is my problem. All too often the editors or translators of the Penguin Classic editions decide that they know better than the ancient author what is valuable about the work for today's reader. Their Plutarch is one such travesty. Their edition of Polybius is another. What makes it more confusing is they can get it right sometime, as with their edition of Livy.I think they are really missing their chance here. The Penguin Classics series is the perfect publishing series for modern and complete editions of ancient authors presented in their original form as much as is possible.Let us look at how personal Campbell's choice is. I happen to be reading The Roman Stoics: Self, Responsibility, and Affection by Gretchen Reydams-Schils. She happens to cite 185 passages from Seneca's Epistles during the course of her book. Because I am The Unmannerly Guest, I took it upon myself to count up how many of those passages were not in Campbell's selection. 122 of the 185 or just over 65%. In other words, she made as much use of the letters Campbell did not publish as those he did. His choices were no more representative of Seneca's thought to Reydams-Schils than the letters he rejected.Here's another way to look at it. Seneca was writing about a philosophy to be lived. Not a system of thought but a guide to behavior. It is inevitable that such a guide would be repetitive. The same sort of issues, of temptations, of annoyances come up again day after day with slight variations (e.g.,anyone trying to raise courteous children knows what I mean). Repetition in an author dealing with such a guide is to be expected; indeed, it is to be appreciated as helpful. It takes time to learn how to live.I think we ought to take old Seneca and Plato and Augustine and Machiavelli and Locke and so on seriously. When we read them we should try to sink into their way of living not just their way of thinking about that life. Only then can we evaluate how much they speak to us.The Penguin Classics, accordingly to this Unmannerly Guest, do not help us in this endeavor. And the fact that they have chosen to present us with a highlighted tour of ancients like Seneca and Polybius is a betrayal of the original mission of the series which was to make the classics easily available to the masses. I speak for those masses as much as anyone. And I say, give me the whole da*@ book. Let me be the one to make the editing decisions.",The unmannerly guest or Penguin butchers a classic author once again.,History,Visit Amazon's Lucius Annaeus Seneca Page,Letters from a Stoic (Penguin Classics),11907.0,hardcover,4.17
658,56568,56568,299582,A3QN1SJPR6L552,0140442103,Karl Janssen,4.0,2011,"Although not the most original philosopher to ever bear the designation of Stoic, Seneca is most likely the best writer that school ever produced. His works are far more accessible to the general reader than the more analytical writings of Epictetus or even the more personal reflections of Marcus Aurelius. Seneca had a true gift with words, which when brought out by a skilled translator results in beautiful, inspirational prose. In this case the translation by Robin Campbell is excellent; the book reads like butter. Some of Seneca's contemporary critics complained that every line he wrote was a motto, and they were not far from the truth. Almost every sentence in this book could be singled out and quoted as ""words to live by.""The basic message of Stoicism that Seneca presents here is profound and vital. The key to a happy life is to live in accordance with nature. This is accomplished by training yourself not to desire more than you have and to learn to be content with what comes to you. Govern your emotions with reason, resign yourself to fate, and free yourself from the attachments of your desires. This includes not only the extravagance with which society distracts us from nature, or the obviously harmful excesses of food and drink, but even the attachment to your own life. Only by conquering your fear of death can you experience true freedom and live a life of quality.While Seneca states the basic concepts of Stoicism in clear and engaging language, he doesn't offer much original thought here. For those deeply interested in Stoic philosophy, these works may act as a supplement to those of Epictetus, but they are certainly no substitute. Even comparing them to Seneca's own works, these letters do not measure up to his deeper dialogues and essays. An obvious problem, common to many Stoic works, is the lack of organization and haphazard hopping from one subject to the next, which precludes an in-depth investigation into any particular topic. Another problem is the frequent digression from philosophical instruction. Oftentimes Seneca avoids specific philosophical ideas and merely sounds off generally on the value of philosophy (by which he means Stoicism) in improving people's lives. Many of the letters are light on philosophy altogether, but do have historical value. For example, Seneca gives us an insider's glimpse into aspects of Roman life such as the gladiatorial games and slavery, and relates interesting anecdotes about Socrates, Cato, and various Emperors. Although all the digressions are filtered through Seneca's uniquely Stoic lens, I found some of the wanderings too far afield for my liking. Though I enjoyed the 42 letters that Campbell has collected here, I can't say I'm eager to get my hands on a complete edition of the 124 letters any time soon.Despite my reservations, any Stoic text is an important text, Seneca's more than most. The ancient wisdom is invaluable, and Penguin has done it justice in this volume.",Every sentence an aphorism,History,Visit Amazon's Lucius Annaeus Seneca Page,Letters from a Stoic (Penguin Classics),11907.0,hardcover,4.17
758,92994,92994,299568,A5URVWLRA0SBW,0140442103,"Amazon Customer ""classics_lover""",3.0,2012,"This book is not the complete letters Seneca. Indeed, it is a selection of only about a third of his letters. The selection criteria, as the editor notes in the beginning, attempts to be objective -- that is, to avoid repetition, to consider letters that are less related to contemporary events which would be incomprehensible to a reader almost 2000 years later, and so on. And yet, at the end, the selection critria must remain, at bottom, purely personal -- as the editor admits. If one is willing to accept this, however, and considers the letters selected as opposed to those which could have been selected, and one gets a very nice collection which shows Seneca's wit quite well (the translator's very British English is an advantage here). Life and death, friendship and loneliness, poverty and riches -- all get a lookover from Seneca's stoic eye.We all can gain, sometimes, from being Stoics, stepping back from the rat race and desire for the latest gizmos, and look inwardly. It is not true, of course, that our happiness is not effected by anything external: Seneca believes a true stoic will not be less happy if he loses his home, wife, and children in a disaster, a position few would accept. But it is correct that often the desires the cause us the most grief, i.e., for more status or electronic gadgets, can be a snare, and that one's happiness is often little affected by such things, one way or the other. Seneca was right: modern studies in psychology, capping thousands of years of human experience, confirm that happiness is only weakly related to income or social status, while it is strongly correlated with having friends, family, and a purpose in life: just as he thought.Of particular importance are his notes about other philosophers, especially the Epicureans, and the difference between them: the Epicureans considered pleasure the goal of life. But they were not hedonists, who consider bodily or sensual pleasure to be of much importance. Real, lasting pleasure can be achieved simply, with friendship, simple food and dwellings, and honest, clean living. The Stoics, while they also advocated simplicity, believed real happiness can only be achieved by distancing oneself mentally from the external world and concentrating on internal virtue. Seneca makes their agreement (preference for a simple, but NOT an ascetic, life) and disagreement (the source of happiness) clear.Seneca was often seen as sympathetic to Christianity. While he himself might well scoff at the idea of being connected to what was, in his days, a tiny cult of strangers from the east in the midst of the Roman world (Seneca, in a letter to his mother, says he consoles himself about his exile by considering how few of the inhabitants of Rome were born there), it is true that his emphasis on virtue and friendship, his contempt for greed and vice, especially the vices of the body -- orgies of food and sex -- for which the upper class Romans were notorious, is very Christian.On the whole, then, this book is both fun to read -- Seneca's wit comes out in translation quite well -- and edifying, teaching one how to live.

With this foundation, she then goes into detail of differences (in the Egyptian understanding of the cosmos) between ""linear time"" and ""cyclical time"" (the ancient Egyptians were big on duality: night / day, good / bad, male / female, and of course, linear / cyclical reckonings of time.)  The first 100 pages are really worth the price of the book for this reason.The remaining 200-ish pages are an encyclopedia of sorts, the symbols, dieties and broader concepts of Egyptian beliefs are explained and cross-referenced.

Surprisingly, this was my first read of the great work. Having skimmed through sections of Elliot's journal and already having read Through the Gates of Splendour, it was the Lord's timing for me to encounter this book. Of course, I was fully aware of Jim Elliot's sold out faith, and of His comprehension of a completely Sovereign God. What struck me personally on the first reading of this work beyond the obvious admiration for such a determined warrior for Christ was in a section entitled: ""The Realized Will."" Here Jim is once again offering his life to God in total consecration. He states: ""as I read Job12:10 again, `In His hand is the life of every living thing,' I recognized that all I am and have is the Almighty's. He could in one instant change the whole course of my life - with accident, tragedy, or any event unforeseen. Job is a lesson in acceptance, not of Blind resignation, but of believing acceptance, that what God does is well done. So, Father, with happy committal I give you my life again this morning - not for anything special, simply to let you know that I regard it as yours. Do with it as it pleases you, only give me great grace to do for the glory of Christ Jesus whatever comes to me, `in sickness and in health' "" (pp. 250-51).Along with Jim Elliott, I want my life to be His.God does all things well.

Sitchin proposes, by way of his unique translations of ancient Sumerian and extant Mesopotamian texts, in conjunction with observations of anomalous megalithic structures and artifacts found around the world, that our solar system is comprised of 12 Planets (counting the Sun and Moon as the Sumerians did) including the as yet undiscovered planet ""Nibiru"", home of the Sumerian Annunaki gods and creators of man. According to Sitchin, Sumerian myths relate how the planet Nibiru, or ""Marduk"", was originally a rouge planet from the far reaches of space that entered our solar system millions of years ago wreaking havoc in it's wake which the after effects are still seen today. At this time there was no Earth, but rather a large watery planet the Sumerians called Tiamat that was once located between Mars and Jupiter, the current location of the asteroid belt. It was the invading Nibiru's moons that smashed into Tiamat causing a large chunk to careen off to become the Earth which later captured one of it's orphaned moons to become our own.Eventually, Nibiru settled into a 3,600yr orbit around our sun and is still lurking out there today slowly making it's latest return. Sitchin postulates that 450,000yrs ago the Annunaki came to Earth to mine for gold they needed for their technology and soon grew tired of the hard labor and decided to create a ""primitive worker"", homo sapiens, to carry on the task. This was later to become the ages of Gods and Men which all ancient cultures speak of and it was only around 10,000yrs ago, with the abrupt end of the last ice age and ensuing world wide devastation, that unable to continue their operations, the decimated Annunaki began the process of ""lowering kingship"" to Earth teaching man how to govern and care for themselves. It was under the leadership of the Annunaki that the Sumerian culture was formed some 5,000yrs ago and that the many anomalous megalithic structures found around the world, like the Pyramids of Giza, were either the direct product of or inspired by these Annunaki gods.As fantastical as all that may sound, Sitchin weaves a compelling tale backed by an avalanche of independent scholarship and unique insight that for many millions of readers has become a gospel of it's own. On the flip side, militant psueodskeptics continue to rail against such speculative claims and have resorted to attacking the man as much as his ideas. Ironically, many of these same ""skeptics"" blindly believe a supernatural God created the universe and man leaving his son to meaninglessly die for our sins, despite the death and destruction he could easily prevent every day if he were real but does not; and yet aliens traveling the stars and genetically engineering other creatures? Now that's just plain crazy! The easy answer to all this is to read it for yourself and make up your own mind. Every ancient culture, including the Sumerians, universally believed flesh and blood beings from the stars came to Earth in antiquity and not only created humans, but interacted with them on a physical level claiming it was not they, but the ""gods"" who gave them civilization and were responsible for constructing many of the uncanny megalithic structures found all over the world. They say that every myth has a core of truth, and if so, regardless of whether you agree with Sitchin's interpretation or not, the 12th Planet will certainly give you pause for thought.Sitchin wholeheartedly believes the ancient tales and the 12th Planet is his attempt to make sense of it all in which he unwaveringly uses his translations of Sumerian texts as an infallible road map. But for as much as this is what makes Sitchin such a great read, it is also his downfall, as is the same for most ancient astronaut theorists, in that it is this same literalism and lack of cautious interpretation that often takes the overall hypothesis well beyond what is warranted by the facts if not common sense.To the reader unaccustomed to dense scholarship, it is understandable that the 12th Planet at times may become cumbersome and confusing, but his writing style is in and of itself easy to follow and well written. With that being said, it is well worth the effort and even if you don't agree with his conclusions, if you are interested in the subject of alternative history and ancient mysteries there is without a doubt no more voluminous a resource than Sitchin. You will be entertained, confused, excited, maybe even offended, but in the end you will be exposed to a chapter of human history that is far too difficult to ignore. The 12th Planet is without a doubt the seminal work of the ancient astronaut theory and should not be missed. Did the Annunaki create man? Is there really a planet Nibiru lurking out there?

The book had a lot of potential, but for me, it really fell flat.Despite the flaws, the book does pretty much cover everything in American history, albeit not a lot of detail.There are numerous problems with the book. The first is the bias. I hate to sound like some raging conservative, but this book had a very liberal bias. He always seems to give credence to a liberal view of historical events rather than a more objective view. For example, Franklin Roosevelt is shown as a saint whose New Deal policies got America out of the Great Depression while Reagan, and his policies, is shown as a complete buffoon. I am not saying whether or not I agree with this type of view, but the point is the bias is there. Another example regards Lyndon Johnson (Democrat) and Richard Nixon (Republican). Although Johnson is derided mainly for his policies in Vietnam, at least his admirable accomplishments are mentioned (namely his Great Society programs). The only things he says about Nixon's presidency are bomb Vietnam and Watergate. None of his more admirable aspects are even mentioned in passing.Another is the omissions. He spends a page explaining colonialism before spending not even a whole page about the Spanish-American War. There is no mention of the explosion of the USS Maine, yellow journalism, or the situation in Cuba. The reader is led to believe the war was nothing more than an imperialistic venture (I know there is a lot of controversy surrounding the Spanish-American War, but still). The section on World War II is woefully lacking and really contains almost no information on the war itself.The book is at times repetitive. Any American who knows anything about American history knows about the unfortunate history of slavery in the United States. So why must Gonick remind the reader again and again in the book up until the Civil War? It wastes space that could have been used for detailing on other subjects. I know that this being a comic book means there is some limits in space, but this is ridiculous.There are also cases of factual errors. For example, he mentions explicitly twice that the Mexican-American War was an undeclared war when in actuality Congress formally declared war on May 13, 1846. He says President Bush (Senior) started the War on Drugs when Nixon was the one that started it.The last several pages (from the 60s on) are almost unreadable because it sounds less like history and more like the author's complaints about the times he was around for. Like this gem:""And who could blame him [George Bush]? Drugs were a real problem! And so were falling real wages, the loss of decent jobs, skyrocketing housing costs, increasing poverty, decaying public schools, an epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases, homelessness, hopelessness, and a near collapse of society within the burgeoning black underclass...""The entire book seems to try to paint the most politically incorrect view of history beyond the point of annoyance. His sense of humor did not always work. Sometimes it was good and others not so much.I would be lying if I said I did not enjoy certain aspects of the book though. I did find the caricatures of many people fun to look at and his style can be fun at times. Although the quality of the cartoons throughout the book vary greatly from extremely poor to way better than anything I could draw.I find it rather difficult to recommend this book. If you know little about American history or are trying to teach someone, especially children, than pass this up. It is far too skewed to be useful in that regard. If you already know American history pretty well and are willing to look pass the liberal bias, than you might find some enjoyment out of it.Update (October 22, 2010): Since writing this review, I have only read one other Gonick work, specifically ""The Cartoon History of the Universe I,"" which I thoroughly enjoyed. It is now clear to me that The Cartoon History of the United States is definitely not up to par, both in content and quality.","Interesting, but Horribly Flawed",History,Visit Amazon's Larry Gonick Page,Cartoon History of the United States (Cartoon Guide Series),28939.0,hardcover,2.0

Most of it is average and ordinary, but a few are truly blessings.  Foster and Smith's ""Devotional Classics"" is a devotional book that fits into the latter category.There's so much I could say about the book, but I'll summarize why this book could be beneficial to so many by making 5 points.1.  The devotional selections are taken from saints from all ages of the church.  The saints range from Church Fathers such as Augustine and Chrysostom, to medieval and 16th-17th century writers such as Bernard of Clairvaux, Lancelot Andrewes, and John Calvin, to modern writers such as C.S. Lewis and Dallas Willard.2.  The selections introduce us to a wide variety of devotional writers who we are now free to investigate further for ourselves.  Foster and Smith provide a brief background for each devotional writer, before the devotional selection.  52 different writers are represented, coming from a wide variety of backgrounds and perspectives.  The selections are brief enough to read in a few minutes but long enough to give us a flavor of the person who is writing.3.  The devotionals are grouped according to 6 sections that represent differentspiritualities: ""Preparing for the Spiritual Life,"" ""The Prayer-Filled Life,"" ""The Virtuous Life,"" ""The Spirit-Empowered Life,"" ""The Compassionate Life,"" and ""The Word-Centered Life.""4.  There are additional helpful materials after each devotional selection: a relevant Bible passage, questions for reflection, and suggested exercises.5.  The material can be used profitably by either individuals or groups, and the 52 readings could be read over the course of a year, one per week.There is one flaw in the book: there are no Sacramental Life or Ecclesiastical Life sections.  Each of these would be the way the ancient and medieval writers would have seen things, and each of which would more properly place private devotions in the context of the Church and Sacraments.In spite of this one weakness, this is an excellent introduction that will hopefully lead many Christians to explore deeper devotions with the saints of all ages.",An Excellent Introduction to Deeper Devotional Reading,History,Richard J.

Schultz,3.0,2010,"I had heard for quite some time that Divided By Faith: Evangelical Religion and the Problem of Race in America, by Michael Emerson and Christian Smith, was the seminal work on race in the American church.  And while I began reading it with high expectations, the authors failed to provide a convincing argument.  The book was full of many useful statistics, anecdotes, and themes, but Emerson and Smith failed to tie it all together in a meaningful and persuasive way.The central thesis of Divided By Faith is twofold: we live in a racialized society, and, despite good intentions, Evangelicals actually make the problem worse, rather than better.  By ""racialized society,"" the authors simply mean that we live in a place where race still matters ""for life experiences, life opportunities, and social relationships,"" opting for this term over the more common phrases of prejudice or racism.  But even here, we do not get a clear explanation of why it matters that we live in a racialized society, at least not from a biblical perspective.  They point to problems such as income disparity, education differences, and de facto segregation--all of which are certainly bad things--as proof of our racialized society.  But what they never tie together is the idea that these bad outcomes are the result of racialization.Secondly, Emerson and Smith say that Evangelicals make the problem worse by having access to a limited ""toolbox"" from which to draw solutions to this problem.  White evangelicals, the authors find, focus on freewill individualism as the chief explanation for the difference in outcomes between whites and blacks, while African Americans point to structural problems, spiritual warfare, and incipient racism as the reason for inequality in America.  Additionally, they find that the more time a white Evangelical spends with African Americans, the more likely he or she will cite structural problems as well.  Here again, unfortunately, we see Emerson and Smith's inability to tie loose ends together.  Both explanations may very well be true, or perhaps only one or the other is correct, but instead of making a convincing case as to why one is right and the other is wrong, the authors just assume that the explanations African Americans give are correct.  Let me be clear, I am not saying that that is not the case, I simply wish that Emerson and Smith would have done a better job proving their thesis.The second half of the author's thesis--that white Evangelicals make the race problem worse--is initially harder to swallow, but interestingly, this is actually the strongest part of their work.  The problem is clearly stated in their description that, following the civil war, whites and blacks went from sitting in separate pews in the same church, to attending different churches entirely.  This is due to the fact that in a free market such as ours consumers choose the product that fits them the best.  In the church world this means that parishioners will attend the church that is the easiest fit for them; the one with the least amount of friction.  Since inter-racial relationships carry with them a certain amount of friction, the authors assert, races will tend to congregate together.  This then strengthens the bonds that already existed between people of the same race, only furthering the de facto segregation that exists in America.  It is from these relationships that better jobs can be acquired, along with a host of other economic and social benefits.  Therefore, separate churches only add to the disparity between the races.Overall Divided By Faith was certainly an interesting read, and while they failed to convince on many points, the book was thought provoking enough to make it worth the time.  No one can deny that, while things have certainly improved, the race problem in America is still an issue that needs to be dealt with, especially for the Evangelical church.  Let us all pray that as we continue to grow in Christ, we would grow closer to racial reconciliation in the Church.Faithfulpolitics.org",Book Review: Divided By Faith,History,Visit Amazon's Michael O.

It expands and elaborates the themes of David Hackett Fischer's classic ALBION'S SEED without the mass of supporting detail that made that book so hard to read.I found only two errors in the pre-1900 chapters of this book:-- Hawai'i is not a distinct ""Polynesian"" culture. It has been part of Yankeedom ever since New England missionaries converted the native ruling class to Congregationalism. Hawai'i cultural and political trends have rigidly followed those of Boston ever since 1850, right down to switching from the Republican to Democratic parties at roughly the same time. Barack Obama went to a classic New England prep school near my home and is culturally 100% Yankee.-- the discussion on p.150-153 of the role of New France in the American Revolution (based on a 1907 source!) is completely wrong. Far from greeting the invading Yankees as liberators and enlisting in large numbers, the Franco-Canadians were forbidden to collaborate by the Catholic Bishop of Quebec, the de facto leader of the province. The two ""Canadian"" regiments were later filled up with recruits from the 13 southern colonies and acted as unofficial ""regular"" units, free of the local political ties of the state-formed line regiments.However, as the book proceeds toward the present, I became less convinced by the author's arguments, probably because his own Yankee cultural affiliation is affecting his judgement. By the Epilogue he has drifted off into ultra-liberal fantasies of American decline, secession and a federal government reduced to EU-like status. Let's get real here - membership in the current USA is so attractive that secession movements never get any real traction, even in outright colonies like Puerto Rico and Guam.","Good history, bad politics",History,Visit Amazon's Colin Woodard Page,American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America,2709.0,hardcover,4.25

858,164097,164097,364407,A2IS16K96YSFDV,0143122029,Eric Mayforth,4.0,2013,"When Americans think of their country in terms of regions, they usually think of just a few--the four-region breakdown of Northeast, South, Midwest, and West to name one example.  But author Colin Woodard argues in ""American Nations"" that there are eleven distinct cultures that make up North America, and refers to these areas as ""nations"" because they exhibit characteristics of nationhood such as a shared culture and outlook.Woodard argues that the eleven nations that reside on this continent--Yankeedom, New France, New Netherland, Tidewater, the Midlands, the Deep South, Greater Appalachia, El Norte, the Far West, the Left Coast, and First Nation--were formed early in our history and retain their essential characteristics and cultures into the twenty-first century, resulting in deep divisions and political clashes in the federations of the United States, Canada, and Mexico.These nations do not fit neatly into state or even national boundaries, either--there is an excellent map at the beginning of the book that defines the nations down to the county level.  Two states, Texas and New Mexico, each have parts of four of the nations within their borders.  Woodard looks back at the origins of each nation and describes the characteristics and culture of each.  The book is even amusing in one such spot--I laughed out loud when reading the attempt of the Borderlanders to form the State of Franklin.Even in the eighteenth century the different nations already had serious conflicts--some wanted independence from Britain and others did not, and the author shows how enough of them were able to throw off British rule and create the American federation when the Crown's misrule united them.  There were difficulties in establishing and ratifying a Constitution and constant tensions and secession movements in many of the nations in the decades after 1789.The author shows how many of the nations spread west after independence, and how the Left Coast and Far West were founded in the nineteenth century.  Woodard recalls how the nations lined up for the Civil War and how the nations ally with and oppose each other on political issues up through the present day.Those of us who grew up in more than one of the nations can read the book and realize that we are hybrids of a sort--for example, I spent my childhood in Southwest Michigan (Yankeedom, and within shouting distance of the Midlands) and spent the rest of my formative years in North Central Texas (Greater Appalachia), and can see that I have some of the traits of each of those three nations.There is some annoying political commentary in the book.  Woodard asserts that the Southern, conservative nations attempt to suppress dissent and display authoritarian tendencies.  But twenty-first century conservatives wouldn't dream of silencing CBS, ABC, the New York Times, etc., while today's liberals would shut down Fox News and talk radio tomorrow if they could get away with it.  One of the two chief political ideologies in America today certainly has strong authoritarian tendencies...and it isn't conservatism.The author asserts that the Northern nations can be counted on to favor liberal measures taken by administrations such as the current one, but immediately after the liberal legislation of 2009-10 was passed, in the 2010 midterms Republican governors, state senates, and state houses of representatives were promptly elected in states as reputedly hostile to conservatism as Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Maine.  In U.S. Senate elections that year, Tea Party favorite Ron Johnson ousted liberal icon Russ Feingold in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania sent strong conservative Pat Toomey to Washington.Also, to advocate for liberalism in a book primarily about geography is to lead with one's chin to about the fourth power--if liberalism is as great as Woodard thinks it is, why do liberal states disproportionately lose congressional seats in each decennial census and why do conservative states disproportionately gain them?  Which areas of the United States in the last few decades have been dynamic and thriving, and which have been stagnant and declining?  In the Nineties when even New York City cut government spending and abandoned many of the policies that Woodard favors, it flourished as it hadn't in decades.Leftists sometimes attempt to assert that people leave liberal states due to climate, but few people consider the climate of booming North Dakota ideal--people go wherever they think they can better their lot in life, which is why conservative states and areas of the country have grown explosively in recent decades.Despite the proselytizing for liberalism, there is enough worthwhile about ""American Nations"" (the nationwide map down to the county level is almost itself worth the price of admission) to satisfy geography mavens of any political stripe.",Regional Cultures Across America,History,Visit Amazon's Colin Woodard Page,American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America,2709.0,hardcover,4.25

This book is a quick, easy read, and Harden adds just enough background info on North Korea to augment rather than interfere with Shin's life story.  Additionally, Harden and Shin courageously depict his inability to assimilate to a new world.  It's not a happy ending, at least not now.In addition to the text, pictures are placed in the middle of the book, contrasting a gaunt and diminutive Shin with the pudgy North Korean dictators who caused so much suffering.

This is an extremely interesting guide for families from a kid's eye view, but don't rule it out for adults either.Chicago is a city of many firsts - the first ferris wheel (1893), first skyscraper (1885), and the first controlled nuclear reaction (1942) et al. Filled with fascinating historical facts about Chi-Town, the guide mentions Scarface, John Dillinger, the Great Chicago Fire, the Haymarket Riot, the World's Columbian Exposition, the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, Frank Lloyd Wright and more.  There's also a wealth of information on attractions such as dying the river green for St. Patrick's Day, free fireworks at Navy Pier, the Chicago Children's Museum, Sue the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the John G. Shedd Aquarium (with Grandad, a rare Australian lungfish) as well as the Lincoln Park Zoo, Six Flags Great America (14 roller coasters!!) and Wrigley Field with its curse.It completes the tour with information on the famous architecture, parks, galleries and libraries, and of course recommendations for great eating and shopping spots. There are also bits of trivia with lists of movies that feature Chicago, slang words, people born in Chicago (Walt Disney, Ernest Hemingway and Harrison Ford) and of course travel tips, maps and the quiz at the end.

A Canadian resident, he drove from the west coast of Canada to New York after watching on TV what we all watched that day.  This had to be an exceedingly difficult book to write, especially within a year after the tragedy happened.  To get the right balance between melodrama and insensitivity required something super human.  David came very close.  I think he did an admirable job.  He showed an amazing facility with language that I wish I had.  His little book (really just a long short story) got to me emotionally, and that, I suppose, was its purpose.  But it was also thoughtfully written with intelligent observations about Canada's great neighbor to the south and its people, especially the author's recognition that we cannot all be put into the same pot, no more than all Canadians, Jews, Africans or any other group can.  His descriptions of what he observed are beautiful in places, a little melodramatic for my taste in other places. Sometimes simple recitation of what you are observing without so many adjectives and metaphors makes the description more powerful.  I thought that was the case with some of  his descriptions. Some of his metaphors, probably too numerous, were brilliant.  Some seemed awkward.

She presents yoga and buddhism concepts in such a simple way and integrates them so well in her story that sometimes I felt like I was also meditating with her.The last part I found less appealing but at the same time it makes us wonder that love is just around the corner if we are open to see it!!!!!!!",Could be the life of any of us,Travel,Visit Amazon's Elizabeth Gilbert Page,"Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia",8606.0,hardcover,4.33

His goal was to complete his journey across this part of the world which was initially denied by the Taliban in 2000.Stewart, decided to walk the distant between Herat in Western Afghanistan to Kabul in the eastern portion of the country. He chose a route that many thought would be impassable in the Winter snows.  This route would for the most part retrace the steps of Babur, the first Emperor of Mughal India as he conquered what to the Western world has been an inconquerable nation.With a few letters of introduction from officials of the new Afghan government, many who easily changed sides in the war, Stewart starts an amazing trek across a land that so many of us in the West no nothing about and even after 10 years of combat, we stil know so little.In the course of his many month journey across Afghanistan, we meet an amazing cast of characters, whose only form of modern technology is an AK-47 and whose common bond is Islam.  Stewart exposes his readers not only to people who despite their primitive surroundings are fairly hospitable people, they are a people that are very diverse in the culture and heritage.  As Stewart treks from region to region, we learn that ancient Jews were part of Afghanistan, we are taken along the Spice Trade route from China, and we are given insight to cities that might well be part of legend.Along the trek, Stewart obtains a companion, a large burly dog who he names Babur, in honor of the emperor whose route he follows and who at the very end of Stewart's tale we learn of his demise.The value of this book is that we learn so much about the true face of Afghanistan; its people, its ancient history and of lost cultures.  We also see the face of the NGOs that enter the nation with an intent to ""do good"" yet they really have no understanding of the people they claim to help.Well worth the read.",The Afghanistan That Is Hidden From Us,Travel,Visit Amazon's Rory Stewart Page,The Places In Between,55985.0,hardcover,4.17

Some people have questioned the accuracy of the information. I cannot speak to that, but obviously situations in some of these, shall we say, less frequented destinations change on a daily basis, as political or military winds blow. So even having a good guide does not preclude information from becoming quickly outdated, and it's each suicidal traveler to his or her own.To be sure, this is real Soldier of Fortune stuff. Robert Young Pelton hits all of the world's hot spots, and there is an edge of sensationalism to the writing.

At least the disclaimer includes the warning that, ""our advice is more likely to kill you than save your life.""

Who on earth would really want to visit god forsaken countries like Sudan or North Korea? Rather, it is a showcase for Pelton's snappy, amusing prose about countries of the world whose citizens have become largely unhinged, either through religious extremism, poverty, military dictatorships, or harsh and morally reprehensible governments. It's a pretty amazing survey of all that can go wrong when the perennial bad boys of the world go on a crusade or a rampage. The murder and mayhem that Pelton documents inundates a large percentage of human beings on this planet, mostly ordinary innocent people trying to cope with the lousy hand that life has dealt them. It is important for the affluent and complacent West understand the daily misery they endure. That might be the one reason you might want to visit say, Bosnia or Chechnya, to be humbled a bit. It's all here: the kidnappings, the massacres, the human slave trade, the insane greed and utter disregard for human life that plagues so much of the world, and much more. There is scant mention of Somalia, possibly because it is a place so awful that even Pelton fears to tread there. All in all, a depressing read that Pelton tries to liven up with a smart aleck sense of humor that is sometimes cynical and cruel.

There is no reason to read this book. I'll just give a brief example here.Chapter 9 is supposed to be about homeroom activities, but it opens by confounding the reader with pages of nonsense on the meaning of classrooms in Japan: ""In every school across the country, students are assigned to a homeroom class, or kumi. The word kumi, which is rooted in the Japanese character for thread, was first used several hundred years ago to describe bands of samurai warriors attached to a feudal lord... The importance of the kumi as an educational tool, however, goes beyond this good-natured team spirit. The classroom that the students inhabited had been, in effect, leased to them by the school, in an arrangement not unlike the way a feudal lord lent land to a group of serfs."" Later, talking about kumi, he writes: ""No one [had warned] me that the country still suffers from the legacy of a four-hundred-year-old feudal class system that was officially outlawed over a century ago.""This is pure fantasy. The word kumi is the Japanese word for ""form"", as in ""fifth form, third year"". All British schools use this system. Japan adopted it from the British and translated the vocabulary. The second sentence I quoted is not even justifiable by strained etymology but is purely an invention of the author's wild imagination, and the third is his bizarre and wrong conclusion.

I wasn't able to grasp the full understanding of what I was feeling until the near end of the book when the graduating children began practicing the bow to perfection. As Feiler too observes, learning to bow is ""far more than a mere social greeting: it is the prime ingredient in the syntax of Japanese life.""Awareness increased, I truly enjoyed this book. Feiler does a fine job presenting a clear picture of his experiences; from the bath to the cast, to the detailed discipline students receive, to the iron watch of their mothers, and how the students received his visit. I did observe however, how similar the fundamental `undercarriage' of Japanese values as it pertains to stressing a higher education, are to customs in America. True, the methods employed to teach children differ, but hovering pressures on stressing education and continuing on to college and beyond are similar.

They are two of a kind, sliding over the more complex issues.  Lene is obviously a super athlete whose ascent of Everest was quite a physical feat.  But she does not address the meaning of Scott's invitation to climb Everest, ""Let's make it happen and have fun,"" in the context of his and eight other's deaths making it happen and having fun.  She adds little to the controversies that swirl around the events pointing fingers at one or another of leaders or clients for their mistakes or even negligence because leaders wanted to get clients successfully up and down and clients wanted to claim victory.  She only mentions Scotts unnecessary trip down which may have contributed to his exhaustion.  She says nothing about the assistance rendered to the New York socialite and its possible ramifications or about the ropes not being set above camp III.  She does nothing to clarify the lack of designation of an absolute turn back time by Scott.  What she does do is exonerate Anatoli Boukreev whom some have accused of failing in his duties by neither using oxygen nor properly attending to the clients.  For her, he is the paradigm of a great climber.  Her books starts out impressionistically with little homilies about the meaning of life and accomplishing things.  This part can easily be skipped.  The book gets better when she goes into her inner narrative while climbing.  I assume she kept a journal.  Her struggles acclimatizing, her fear, and reliance on her past training  are all interesting pictures of what it takes in this extreme sport.  She does touch upon Beck Weathers', who came back from the dead twice on the mountain, observation that climbing is a way of avoiding other life issues.  She wonders how men and women with families can so risk their lives. She gets off on the sociability and fraternity like atmosphere of the camps.  But when it comes to the final ascent she is mostly concerned with taking care of herself.  In the end she is saved from freezing to death by someone else.  I wonder in reading all of these books how much hypoxia on the upper reaches of the mountain clouds everyone's minds making their rendition of the events questionable.  I wouldn't recommend this book unless you, like me, are hooked on the madness of mountain climbers.

Instead, it recounts a Christmas holiday the author spent at a house that has been in his French wife's family for eons, located in the countryside quite some distance from Paris.  Second, the book does not include a lot of useful or concrete information.  You will find no recipes, nor even a description of the preparation of this grand Christmas dinner nearly detailed enough to allow a reader to attempt to replicate the meal.  When the author does include some concrete information -- about wine for example -- he is just plain wrong.  He announces that the 1998 and 2001 vintages in Bordeaux are ""widely considered to be the best.""  Pas du tout.  '98 was a very spotty vintage in the Medoc, although reputedly quite good for the merlot-based wines of St. Emilion and Pomerol; while '01, following the heavily hyped and overpriced 2000 vintage, was largely underrated in the press for quite some time and is just now garnering some respect.  When author and wife locate a case of 1998 Ch. les Eyquem de Margaux offered at 10 euros at the hypermarche in a nearby town, he observes ""this was one of the most respected Bordeaux of the Medoc"" and that ""one could easily pay 50 euros"" for the wine in ""a branch of Nicolas,"" the French wine retailer.  Wrong again.  Les Eyquem is a small, undistinguished estate that barely rates a mention in Cocks & Feret; and the wine should typically sell for 10 euros to 15 euros a bottle at retail -- anything more would be an astounding rip off.  The author also tells us, at one point, that the oysters he bought days before his Christmas dinner will be just reaching their peak of perfection when Christmas dinner rolls around.  Vraiment?So why the four stars?  Because, like a Hostess cupcake, the book somehow manages to take a hodgepodge of undistinguished ingredients and combine them into an irresistible, albeit guilty pleasure.  As the author rambles on amiably about his first wife, his childhood in Australia, how he met his French second wife ""Marie-Do"" and pulled up stakes to join her in Paris, how he learned to love and be loved by her idiosyncratic family, the book becomes as warm and comfortable as an old shawl -- and as pleasantly nostalgic as the cheap factory made, cellophane wrapped chocolate cupcake with the white sugary squiggle on top.It's skillfully done and the perfect book to take along to read by the fire when you're spending a winter holiday with your own friends and relations far from home.",A Hostess cupcake of a book,Travel,Visit Amazon's John Baxter Page,Immoveable Feast: A Paris Christmas (P.S.),157786.0,hardcover,4.0

I did well in calculus and physics, but understanding concepts and doing well in class aren't always the same.  At last a book has explained in a understandable way the concepts of calculus, relativity, point theory, string theory and quantum mechanics.  I liked the hyperbole and the comments that made this read entertaining and enlightening.  If you don't have a background in the sciences, you may want to pass as the second half of the book gets into science that isn't easy.  However, the first half does a great job of showing how something we take for granted (zero), had to be introduced into the world a number of times before it became standard in the ways of thinking.  While the illustrations are lacking in number and detail, those that are there do a good job of explaining the concepts.  I had planned on giving this to my daughters 8th grade math teacher who loves math, but again, only the first part is relative to math people at the basic level.  Those that look at calculus and marvel that someone could actually come up with the concept, will realize what imagination the great thinkers had and our technological leaps are made possible only because people saw things in a different manner.  I can only marvel at what would be possible these days if Newton and his peers had been around these days to add to string theory, relativity etc. Given the number of so called skeptics these days who hogwash creative thinking and new science, it is easy to imagine the pressure from the church and other outside influences that had vested interest in keeping these discoveries quiet.",Did you miss this in school?,Science & Math,Visit Amazon's Charles Seife Page,Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea,30035.0,hardcover,4.33

Plus, for the chapters that I knew the most about, I lamented the lack of footnotes, which isn't really a fair criticism of a popular science work. The book quickly won me over, though, and I often found myself reluctant to put it down. The story presented here is about much more than math: there's history, philosophy, religion, and modern physics too. Much of the material was already familiar to me, but Seife brought it all together into a satisfying overview of the evolution of western thought.

Have you ever thought about the number zero, at least lately?  Most of us probably never gave it a second thought.  I haven't, until I opened this fascinating book.""This is the story of zero, from its birth in ancient times to its growth and nourishment in the East, its struggle for acceptance in Europe, its ascendance in the West, and its ever present threat to modern physics.""The author begins with a brief history of numbers and the origin of zero, which, most likely, originated in the East.  He continues with the greatly scattered and diverse civilization and cultural influences.  His style is witty and humorous, at times beyond excess.  As zero is studied in depth and applied mathematically, the bazaar and the mysterious begin to surface.  The concept of infinity for example; this possibility led to further discoveries and mind boggling hypotheses.  Eventually, the East would clash with the West.Given that Seife uses spirituality extensively, I am compelled to comment.  I find it difficult to ascertain this man's true beliefs although, there are hints.  Not only does he establish varied religions and philosophers as contributing to mathematics, specifically, zero, but, they have also influenced his personal beliefs as well; he quotes them liberally.  He seems to combine all philosophies in order to come to his own rational view of the world.  In some respects he is truly secular, believing that our intellect has gained over time, even though his treatise goes against that.  He indicates the world came into being by chance, but as he discovers more about zero he sees God (to ""know the mind of God"").  But I believe he is only using God in the contextual.  He is absolutely right concerning the adverse effects of Aristotle on the Jew and Christian.  He supports protestant rationale.  In the end, according to Seif, zero has given rise to both the proof, and death of God.

I felt confident that she had a broad base of knowledge from which to launch her ideas and recounts.  She also took pains to explain potentially novel terms (such as ""snaffle bits"" on p.236), so that the reader wasn't left behind, entangled in trying to figure out unfamiliar jargon.That being said, I do have a few challenges to share.  I felt at times that there was just too much information placed into chapters and that information didn't always directly relate to the chapter's subject matter.I also think that readers may expect this book, written by a Ph.D., to simply be packed with cold hard facts that are backed up by research.  Although these do exist throughout the work, the book also contains a lot of insights and personal thoughts that are simply assumptions.

But one thing keeps annoying me throughout the text: her constant use of the term ""animals"" when she really means ""mammals"" or specifically livestock. She makes generalizations such as ""animals are visual creatures"" which is certainly not true for all animal species. She's specifically talking about livestock and hoofstock, but she's not using the specific term. On page 59, she uses dung beetles in an example of differing forms of sensory perception but then actually writes ""I know dung beetles are insects, not animals, but...""Um, what?

Though Grandin's plainspoken writing style is refreshing, I often felt like she was oversimplifying very complex ideas in order to appeal to a scientifically illiterate audience (or worse, to make her arguments more convincing). Statements such as ""Autism is a kind of way station on the road from animals to humans"" aren't just over-dramatic (and ultimately nonsensical), they're also potentially offensive. Much of the book is purely speculative, and I'm left wondering whether it's really appropriate to write a popular science book that's mostly about completely untested hypotheses (this seems to be a growing trend in popular science literature, but that's another discussion entirely).At the very least, Grandin could have been clearer in differentiating between 1) widely accepted scientific consensus, 2) well regarded schools of thought, 3) contested minority theories, 4) solitary experiments that have not been reproduced, 5) purely anecdotal evidence from her own life or that of friends, and 6) her own untested hypotheses. As is, they all sort of blur together, and a reader not entirely familiar with how science works might be led to buy into Grandin's arguments with less skepticism than is warranted. It certainly didn't help that many of the studies and ""facts"" she mentioned weren't even cited. Those that were were often cited as news publications ABOUT scientific studies rather than directly citing the studies themselves. It's important to remember that much of what is written about in the book is outside of Grandin's own area of professional expertise, and though I think it's perfectly fine to write about a topic you don't have a degree in, it was things like that that made me wonder whether Grandin herself could stand to be a little more skeptical, methodical, and cautious. To put it simply, I trusted her when she was talking about farm animals and dogs, less so when she was talking about neuroscience and other kinds of animals, and not at all when she tried giving insight into stuff like politics or child rearing.One constant point of annoyance: For someone with a PhD in Animal Science, I was astounded that Grandin seemed to have no idea whatsoever of what the word ""animal"" even means. The book was littered with phrases like, ""Animals feel pain. So do birds, and we now have pretty good evidence that fish feel pain too"" or ""I know dung beetles are insects, not animals, but..."" Since distinguishing between the six taxonomical kingdoms is one of those things you learn in 9th grade bio class, I can only assume that Grandin is dumbing down for her audience. This has the duel effect of insulting the intelligence of those readers who have a basic grasp of Bio 101, and spreading misinformation and confusion among those who don't.The confusion over the category of ""animal"" extends to talking about humans as well: ""People were animals too, once,"" she writes. And what - we're not any more? Throughout the book, Grandin condemns overgeneralizing (a vice she associates with ""normal people"") and champions a pragmatic focus on specific details (a skill she associates with autistic people and animals) as the best way to handle any situation. Yet Grandin is guilty of many massive over-generalizations (the aforementioned ""waystation"" idea being one example, her failure to treat autism as a spectrum being another). And among the most frustrating of these for me was Grandin's view of humanity's relationship to the rest of the animal world, which is vague, romantic, and naive. Statements like ""dogs and people belong together"" or ""people and animals are supposed to be together"" amount to nothing more than mushy utopianism. What exactly would such a thing even mean? Together how? Grandin never elaborates.Her idea of ""nature"" is pretty unscientific as well. At one point she asks, ""Is animal infanticide really what nature intended? Or is it, at least some of the time, an aberration of what nature intended?"" That question doesn't even begin to make logical sense. What kind of mystical nature is Grandin talking about that has things like intention? Nature doesn't intend. There are no aberrations in nature. These are human concepts. Nature just is. Even if she takes the classic anthropocentric view of defining nature as ""everything in the world except humans and things made by humans,"" the question still doesn't make any sense. Animals have been killing their young long before humans even existed. What Grandin really means to say is that animal infanticide seems to serve no evolutionary purpose. This may be debatable. But either way, plenty of animal (and especially human) behaviors serve no apparent evolutionary purpose. ""Evolutionarily advantageous"" is not the same as ""natural"" and neither of those is the same as ""right,"" ""good,"" ""moral"" or what have you.All that having been said, Grandin's many anecdotes are entertaining and there's a lot of cool ideas to chew on throughout. If you're an avid reader of pop neuroscience or animal studies books, you might already have encountered a good deal of this stuff, but the parallels Grandin draws are interesting (even if I'm skeptical of some of them) and her emphasis on ""getting inside the black box"" of the animal mind is an important one. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book, even if I was often frustrated with it.","Deeply flawed, though enjoyable and thought provoking",Science & Math,Visit Amazon's Temple Grandin Page,Animals in Translation: Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior (A Harvest Book),31591.0,hardcover,4.0

My eye was attracted by the cartoon cover and, after a quick scan, I decided to buy it.  It was worth it.Larry Gonick and Woollcott Smith cover the same content as many introductory statistics books.  The eleven core chapters cover basic statistical concepts, the nature of data, and the essentials of probability, random variables, distributions, sampling, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, comparing samples, designing experiments and regression.  It is a lot of material that flows quickly.  The final chapter introduces ""a biased sample"" of advanced statistical techniques.  A bibliography--reasonably up-to-date when the book was published--points the reader on to further learning about statistics.The book's title gives the fun part away.  The authors use the panel-by-panel presentation style and humorous asides of cartoons as their primary mode of presentation.  This works surprisingly well.  It makes readers--particularly those intimidated by statistics--comfortable and ready to just read the panels.  An instructionally useful side effect is the repeated use of graphical rather than textual definitions of statistical concepts.  The tongue-in-cheek humor reinforces the relaxing experience of reading cartoons and eases the learning experience.I have never required this book as a text for a statistics class.

This was a question I faced on a second year classical mechanics exam. I got the question right, by the way. As a matter of fact, I scored a perfect 100% on the entire exam but it bothered me immensely that I should be able to prove something mathematically without having the foggiest inkling as to ""why"" it should be so at a much more fundamental level.In fact, it troubled me so deeply that after I received my undergraduate degree in Physics, I declined to pursue any further education in the field and went on to a career in business and finance.In ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"", Gary Zukav has written a superb explanation as to why my lack of understanding was so normal and why I should have embraced that lack of understanding as opposed to running away from it. In very clear prose, completely devoid of the baffling language of mathematical equations, he has written a story for those of us interested in exploring the mind-expanding (nay, mind-blowing) discoveries of modern advanced physics and cosmology -quantum mechanics; black holes; time travel; entanglement; action at a distance; special and general relativity; the nuclear particle zoo; and much, much more.I reveled in the discovery that even Einstein struggled with the notion that he would never be able to compare his mathematical models with the ""real"" mechanism. Indeed, he couldn't even imagine the meaning of such a comparison.A magnificent blend of philosophy, eastern mysticism and modern physics, Zukav's ""The Dancing Wu Li Masters"" is perhaps best summarized by a single sentence from a New York Times Book Review:""Stripped of mathematics, physics becomes pure enchantment ... ""While this isn't a book that would likely be accessible to someone without a foot already inside physics' door, it is a breathtaking, joyous revelation to people like myself who have that basic grounding and are looking to increase their knowledge.What the heck, if I had read this in the 1970s instead of waiting until now ... who knows, my entire life and career path might have been changed.Highly recommended.Paul Weiss",Rats ...

In describing the evolution of physics, he places it in the contexts of language, perception, and our relationship to reality.Where the book falls short, or actually irritates, is in his frequent and superficial references to Hinduism and Buddhism. It is ironic that he does so without a trace of humility or uncertainty, given that, in the final chapter, Zukav himself observes that ""to 'understand' something is to give up some other way of conceiving it."" In this case, he gave up conceiving of non-dualism as a philosophy found in many religious traditions, including Jewish mysticism.Still, for the uninitiated, like me, ""Dancing"" is an interesting journey into the weird world of quantum physics.",Both interesting and irritating,Science & Math,Visit Amazon's Gary Zukav Page,Dancing Wu Li Masters: An Overview of the New Physics,50939.0,hardcover,3.67

847,160454,160454,316422,ASSG127YCNDUL,0142004405,Audiobook Bandit,2.0,2013,"I want to preface my review of this book by saying that I looked up Gerald Durrell on the internet and read a bit about his life.  By Wikipedia's account, he seems to have been a good person - a man who was ahead of his a time in promoting conservation, the ethical treatment of animals, and the use of zoos as vehicles for rescuing endangered species through captive breeding programs.  He seems to have been good-hearted man with a true love of people, nature, and animals.  I would not have known any of this, however, had I merely read his book.Birds, Beasts, and Relatives is a set of stories about Gerald Durrell and his family that takes place in the late 1930s on the Greek island of Corfu.  The humor in the book is of the mean-spirited variety, in which people are disrespectful to each other and insult one another frequently.  Thus, throughout the book, we are treated to the angst-filled tirades of Gerald's brothers Leslie and Lawrence, as they complain bitterly about this trivial thing or that - along with mean-spirited descriptions of people that include adjectives like ""fat,"" and ""ugly"".  The situational comedy is similarly unpleasant, involving drunk people showing up at all hours of the night, and people almost drowning.  Why any of this is supposed to be funny is beyond me; it is definitely not my kind of humor.The author's treatment of animals - as described within the book - is also somewhat disturbing.  Mr. Durrell was a collector of animals from a young age.  However, the impression that I got from this book was that he did not really care (much) about the welfare of the animals he kept, but was rather more concerned about the act of collecting.  For example, in one story the young Gerald Durrell captures three baby hedgehogs, and has visions of raising them as pets.  When his sister accidentally overfeeds and kills them, Gerald is saddened - but not so much by their deaths as by the fact that his daydream of keeping these unusual pets is destroyed.  Similarly, when Gerald is introduced to a Gypsy man who owns a dancing bear, his concern is not for the welfare of the bear, but on how he might go about acquiring the bear for himself.  Throughout the book, there seems to be a careless, selfish nature to Gerald's animal collecting:  animals are introduced and promptly forgotten - never to be heard of again; pets are acquired without proper preparation or means for their care.  Always, Gerald seems to be on the lookout for the `next great thing', and one is left wondering how well he was able to care for his ever-growing menagerie.In addition to these flaws, I found the writing itself to be only mediocre.  In a number of places, a word is used too frequently, or in a way that I found jarring to read.  Gerald's brother Leslie, for example, is several times said to have spoken ""truculently,"" - a word that sounds forced even when it's not overused.  Unnecessary adverbs abound when richer descriptions would have served better; I even found an I/me error, which is an unforgivable grammatical transgression.  I'm not trying to pick at nits here, but these sorts of things detract from my enjoyment of a book.The book does have a few redeeming features.  Some of the descriptions of Corfu are wonderful, and for brief moments, one gets the sense of the beauty and wonder that Gerald Durrell must have felt as he as fished and explored the area.  What a pity that he did not choose to focus more on those sentiments!As I read this book, I kept thinking about James (Herriot) Wight's book All Creatures Great and Small.  In many ways the setup is the same:  stories of a young man with a love of animals, growing up in the early 1900s in a somewhat exotic locale.  But while All Creatures Great and Small is hilarious, heartwarming, and one of my favorite books of all time, this one is just ""blah"".  For me, I believe the key difference is that the former is full of love and empathy - while this one is decidedly not.  Part of that may be due to the time-of-life about which these two authors wrote.  Mr. Herriot wrote about his twenties and thirties, while this account of Mr. Durrell is from when he was less than ten years old.  When you're very young the world *does* seem to revolve around you, and that may be the reason for some of the selfishness depicted within these pages.  But while this may partially explain why this book seems hollow to me, it does nothing at all to improve it.",Mostly just beastly,Science & Math,Visit Amazon's Gerald Durrell Page,"Birds, Beasts, and Relatives",27415.0,hardcover,4.0

It allows them to be successful in a world where they depend upon humans to survive. He calls canine cognition ""dognition"" and explains there are some areas dogs (even puppies) have abilities that justify the term ""genius"", while they perform average or even below average in others when tested.When the writing is anecdotal, it's fascinating.  Hare traveled in Russia, Germany and Africa to study other species (such as Russian silver foxes bred to become friendly to humans and bonobos, apes that are similar to chimpanzees but much less aggressive) using what he learned in his research into the canine mind.While I was intrigued with reading about his research with dogs and what he learned, when he describes the myriad of tests and their results, Hare slips into ""AcademicSpeak"", which probably comes natural to a scientist who writes papers for scientific journals. (Here's where Woods' journalistic abilities could have injected the writing with a bit more verve--if one can make scientific tests seem exciting.) Certain jargon is used repetitively--in one five-line paragraph, I counted the word ""cognitive"" five times, a bit much for this reader since there are synonyms that could replace it occasionally.Still, the book is interesting enough to keep reading through the slightly (dare I say it?) drier sections to find out more about how the emotional bond dogs have with humans affects their ability to understand and communicate with us. They watch us and make inferences from their observations. (Ever notice that your dog drops the ball in front of you, not behind you?  That's because your dog actually understands you'll see it if it's in front of you, not behind you, and--if he's lucky--toss it in a game with him.)It's obvious by the book's end that many of the theories about how dogs interact with humans and why are now obsolete, even those still in use by so-called ""experts.""  Brian Hare convinced me his research into canine cognition (there's that word again) is ground-breaking and valid.Dog lovers feel that our pets are smart. Now we have access to the research that proves it. If you're a dog lover who would like to understand more about how your dog thinks and what he or she understands, I recommend this book to you.

It was definitely the highlight of my commute - and brightened some household chores as well! I first encountered Hare&#8217;s studies in a magazine article and later in a documentary special (on PBS, I think). And though there was more context into the studies, there wasn&#8217;t quite as much detail and new information as I had hoped for. Despite some of this overlap, though, this was still a very interesting listen. The authors offered more of a historical perspective and also studies that showed conflicting results. Though the author&#8217;s obvious affection for dogs might seem like it would obviously skew the results, their devotion to the scientific method and maintaining genuine objectivity was still quite evident.Amongst the clear descriptions of experiments, the authors offered anecdotes and examples of dog genius outside of the lab. I especially enjoyed the section of speculation on the true history of the domestication of the wolf and development of the dog. The conversational style worked well in the audio format, and I sincerely hope that the authors continue to publish their findings in this mainstream medium. While the narrator was not the most dynamic, his voice worked well for this non-fiction topic. A physical format, though, would lend itself better as a stepping stone for further independent research, so I will be keeping an eye out for the physical format as well. All in all, though, this was a great listen and I will continue to follow their research into dog-nition.",Fascinating!,Science & Math,Visit Amazon's Brian Hare Page,The Genius of Dogs: How Dogs Are Smarter Than You Think,27733.0,hardcover,5.0

Wright ""Birder and reader""",2.0,2014,"Far from illustrating ""every species,"" this book fails to provide photographs of something like 70 extant hummingbirds. I did not expect photos of Alfaro's hummingbird, but even such widespread and common birds as the plain-capped starthroat go without illustration. The images that are included range from the captivating (a minority) to the oddly frumpy (a majority); the uneven quality is a sad surprise given Fogden's other published work, much of which is simply first-rate. The fault certainly lies with the design and the printing: most of the birds are ""cut out"" from their backgrounds and reproduced, more often that not as blurry smudges, on a painfully glossy white paper.The texts given to each species (including those without photographs) are concise and on the whole accurate. It's odd, though, to find the statements of distribution and abundance occasionally incomplete, even misleading. There is no mention of the Arizona range of the berylline hummingbird, even though the species occurs there annually and has bred. The Xantus's hummingbird is said to have wandered to California ""on occasion,"" with no note recording the celebrated British Columbia bird -- almost certainly seen by more humans than any other member of the species in history. Such cases make me hesitant to rely on the text for the many hummingbirds I know less well or not at all.The extremely abbreviated bibliography gathers onlya decidedly eclectic, perhaps even random selection of titles, and omits the most important hummingbird identification guide published in the twentieth century, Steve Howell'sHummingbirds of North America: The Photographic Guide.All in all, it's difficult to imagine who will be entirely satisfied with this book. Far better to save your dollars (lots and lots of dollars) and buy the hummingbird volume in the Handbook of the Birds of the World, of which this is a pale and disappointing shadow.",A disappointment,Science & Math,Michael Fogden,Hummingbirds: A Life-size Guide to Every Species,32647.0,hardcover,2.0
